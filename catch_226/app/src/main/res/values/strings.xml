        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

        "
        Tara waits in line, her foot tapping impatiently. The backs of the heads in front of her are discussing some midterm paper, reminding her that her own is now a week and 3 days late. Shit. She should go to the library after she eats, but she probably won’t. She’s been feeling sort of listless lately, her mind wandering uncontrollably during class even though she considers herself a pretty focused student. Coffee fixed that at first but these days it might as well be water. Plate in hand, she goes to sit. A couple people say hi to her when they pass and Tara offers a trace of a smile in response, barely looking.
	    She finds her friends sitting at a round table in the corner. They’re talking quietly, heads kind of bent together, as Tara approaches. Annabelle sees her, head snapping up, and Tara knows something’s up. That glint in her eye only appears when it’s something good.
	    “What?”
	“Have you heard?” The glint sparkles.
	Tara grabs a carrot stick off of Paris’ plate and bites, feigning nonchalance. With Annabelle, it’s best not to take the bait too quickly.
	Paris grabs her arm, shaking it roughly. “Bruh, this is crazy-y-y,” she sings.
	Tara rolls her eyes, conceding. “What is it?”
	Wordlessly, Annabelle slips a sheet of paper from her backpack and slides it over to Tara. Tara narrows her eyes, reading. Ladies, it’s time…
	“The fuck?” She looks up. Paris is giggling, a hand covering her mouth. Annabelle is shaking her head. “Where did you get this?”
	“Library bathroom,” Annabelle says. “Apparently they’re in all the girls' bathrooms, except for the dorms.”
	Tara looks around, now seeing that several tables are poring over identical white sheets. Even a long table of burly football guys are passing around one of them, laughing and grunting loudly, slapping each other’s shoulders. She turns back sharply to her friends. “Pretty funny joke,” she says tentatively. She’s not sure how she should react.
	Annabelle clasps her hands, lips pursed, back straight as an arrow. She has great posture.
	“Whoever wrote this read my mind, I swear,” Paris chimes in, picking up her fork.
	They finish eating, the conversation kept to a minimum. They’re all trying to hear what people around them are saying.
	I can’t believe this is real
    This school is so wack
	I bet it was that girl from our math class. You know, the one who never speaks. I bet it’s someone totally random
	A blur of green flannel walks past their table, and Tara looks up, then looks down quickly. It’s him. He sits with his friends just out of view. She has to know if their table has a copy. Now’s as good a time as ever to get more water. She gets up, slowly passing tables. His head stays ducked, but she can see they don’t have a paper. They’re not even talking, just eating ferociously. Pigs.
	When she gets back to the table, Annabelle’s standing, bag on her shoulder. “I’m ready to go.”
	The fall breeze is pleasant, picking up and tossing Tara’s hair. She scrapes it into a bun. Annabelle zips up her cute LuluLemon warm-up jacket. Paris’ clunky combat boots stomp loudly, kind of ruining the vibe.
	“I’ll do it if you guys do,” Paris says, glancing at Tara and Annabelle hopefully.
	“I’m down,” Tara says. “Might as well.”
	“I mean, you both kind of already are,” Annabelle says. “It’s different for me.”
	Tara bristles, linking her arm with Paris’. “Well, we can’t all be so lucky,” she says. Annabelle started dating Garrett, a soccer player, last month, finally breaking down after he chased her for like a year. Nowadays Tara sleeps in their shared room alone.
	When they get back to the dorm, Annabelle gets in the shower without skipping a beat. Tara slips out and knocks on Paris’ door before going in.
	“You okay?” she asks. “She shouldn’t have said that to you.”
	“She said it to you too,” Paris replies.
	“Yeah but it’s different,” Tara says. It’s been about a month since her last hookup, but it’s been way longer for Paris. The room falls silent. “I think I’m gonna do it,” Tara whispers.
	Paris smiles. “Let’s do it then.”
The next morning before class, they draw little x’s on the inside of their wrists with Sharpie like the letter said.

*

His hand slides up my leg but he’s already leaving. The words neither of us would say hang dead in the air. Choking me. His kisses are hurried, wanting. I hang on longer than I should. ‘I just don’t really fuck with women’ he tells me, his dick still wet. I’m special or I’m nothing. White knuckles, roaring chest, quickening breath. My clothes are strewn. I never want to put them on again. I let my stomach hang, legs splayed out, but my throat stays tight. When the cold hits my face, slapping the warmth sharply, I think I don’t fuck with men.

*

	“Was it you?”
	Crystal jumps, yanking out her headphones. She didn’t see Josie sidle up beside her. “No,” she snaps, gripping her tote bag tighter under her arm. “God, why do people keep asking me that?”
	“Come on, you know why,” Josie says, smirking.
	She knows Josie’s kidding, like Ellie from down the hall did while they brushed their teeth this morning and Dan did, elbowing her good-naturedly during English, but it still annoys her. “Don’t pull on my sleeve,” she says, shaking her arm free from Josie’s grasp. “This jacket’s like a thousand dollars. Mat shipped it as a thank you after the shoot.” She peeks at Josie from the corner of her eye to see if that shut her up. Crystal got scouted from Instagram two months ago and just got back from her first trip to L.A. for a couple of modeling gigs.
	Josie just rolls her eyes, laughing, which only annoys Crystal more.
	“I didn’t write it, but it’s not a bad idea. I’ve been done with the guys at this school for a minute,” she says.
	“The letter was so whiny though,” Josie says. “I bet it was some blonde girl on lacrosse whose ugly ass boyfriend cheated on her with some other blonde girl on lacrosse.”
	Crystal quirks a smile. Josie’s right. She agrees with the sentiment, but the letter was whiny. The way it started with “ladies” like everyone would just automatically agree. Like everyone gets treated the same. Crystal knows that’s not true. Without Instagram and TikTok, she’d think she was ugly. Every viral video, the comments telling her what she needs to hear, keep her sane. The most popular ones are her get ready with me’s and behind-the-scenes from shoots. Her favorites, though, are the ones where she gives advice. What I wish I knew freshman year as a Black girl at a PWI. She gets fewer likes, but even just one comment saying thank you makes her feel good.
	Josie stops as they reach the door of their film class. “Ask your friends, they probably know,” she tells Crystal.
        “I doubt it,” Crystal says, but when she gets to her seat, she types out a quick text to Tara. Who are you thinking? The girl with horned-rim glasses in front of her twists around to pass her today’s handout. As Crystal grabs it, she notices an x on her wrist, clearly traced a few times in purple pen. The professor starts the lecture, and Crystal’s already bored. She digs out her pencil case and draws an x.

*

She thought about asking him, except that his eyes flicked away a beat too quickly when he said hello back. Playing it cool made her sweat, beads dripping onto paper, smearing the ink. She studied the moisture bleeding her notes together. She couldn’t possibly be imagining his stare, not when it was burning this hole at the nape of her neck. Excitement fluttered through her as she gathered her stuff and stood up. It perished when he shuffled out, head pointed away, away.

*

	Paris methodically scoops the orange goo out of the jar, smoothing it onto her curly, waist length locks. If she doesn’t do this twice a day, her hair frizzes wildly. When she finishes her routine, she traces the little black x on the inside of her wrist. She doesn’t know if it’s even necessary. The x has always been there, visible or not. When Annabelle first showed her the letter at dinner that day, a knot formed in her stomach like it did whenever the girls talked about sex. In freshman year, there were more of them, and she didn’t feel strange as often as she did now, as a junior. Most of the other girls who also came to college as virgins didn’t have real reasons like she did. Maybe they went to girls' schools, or were super focused on academics in high school and never got around to it. Her mother had prepared her to deal with the pressure, leaving Bible passages printed out from the internet on her bed to greet her when she got home from school. But she’d never really needed much convincing. When Tara stumbled home next to her fighting tears because Tate or Jake or Eli had ignored her at the bar, she wasn’t exactly enticed. She wanted what Annabelle had, someone who pined and waited and sent her paragraphs of his feelings for her until she caved. She’d wait until someone was willing to do that. The x would stay.
    She smooths her hair one last time before pursing her lips at the mirror. She knows she’s hot. She doesn’t have to prove it.

*

    Around me, bodies writhe, pushing and shoving towards the beat. Better that I’m here, not in his room, not tonight. Call it what you want, he’d said, but words betrayed me. He hugs me close when we fuck. His chest feels like cold granite against my cheek.  Down I go, that sinking sensation where you don’t want to be here but your feet won’t let you go anywhere else. Every night is the same. Feeling leaves my body when I see his hair, tufts peeking out between his cap and the collar of his jacket. He’s peeling it off, turning. Go, go, I think, and I grab. Her arm is what my hand finds, clamping down. It anchors me.

*

	Tate faces his locker, pretending to look for something. The guys are downright rambunctious today, talking and laughing animatedly.

*

    My therapist is having a baby and today was our last session. Slut. I sit in my car for a while after feeling sorry for myself. He walks past the car while I’m talking about him. She says I’m bored and I shouldn’t attach meaning to every little thing. He throbs inside me all the time. I burned him too, is the thing. Messed around with a few of his teammates. I don’t know why. It was before we did anything but he wanted to. He always did. Even those days when he lived two doors down. That time he walked in on me changing, ran off and texted me he liked what he saw. When we played tennis when the courts were free and I pretended to cry as a strategy. He freaked out. When I cried for real. He didn’t. He liked me before I lost 20 pounds that fall and after just the same. He’s not a douchebag, he just tries so hard to be. I’m warm when he wipes me up after. He wipes the dirtiness away. Affection on his face when I say I like his hair long like that, he tries to hide his smile. But he can’t help it.

*

	Annabelle adjusts her backpack over her shoulders. It’s heavy, filled with her computer, a change of clothes, and books for tomorrow’s classes. Having a boyfriend who lives across campus has introduced somewhat of a nomadic lifestyle. She trudges towards his dorm, picking up the pace when she feels a couple droplets of rain fall on her head. When she gets inside, she starts. Garrett and his suitemates are sitting on the couch silently, staring at a football game. She sinks next to Garrett slowly, kissing him hello.
	“So,” Nick finally says, turning towards her. “What do you think about this…pact.”
	Annabelle smiles thinly. “What do you think, Nick?” Garrett squeezes her knee.
	“It’s fucking bullshit, obviously,” he says. “Every girl in my stats class has an x on their wrist. It’s just for show. Get one of them alone and you’ll see.”
	Nick is Annabelle’s least favorite of Garrett’s friends. A notorious womanizer, he tried to get his paws on Paris last semester, to no avail. Annabelle has nothing to say, so she just gets up and walks to Garrett’s room, collapsing on the bed. He’s right behind her.
	“Nick’s so fucking dumb,” he says. “Sorry.”
	Garrett curls up next to Annabelle and puts his head in her lap. She works her fingers through his hair, scratching softly. “Obviously I can’t relate,” Annabelle says. “But you should see Tara after a shitty night. It’s brutal out here.”
	Garrett’s head moves in her lap as he nods. “The guys are all worked up,” he says. “They’re just ghosting their hookups, waiting for them to cave first.”
	Annabelle shoves him off and stands beside the bed, stretching her arms over her head. She remembers what it was like for her a few months ago, before she could just come here and scratch Garrett’s head and hold him. “If I wasn’t dating you, I’d probably do it.”
	Garrett sits up. “You shouldn’t not do anything just because we’re dating,” he says slowly.
	“Okay,” she whispers, sinking back down onto the bed.
	They sit cross-legged, facing each other. She hands him her wrist and he hands her his. They draw x’s for each other.

*

The water was hot, beating her back roughly. It felt nice to rub shampoo in his hair, to work her fingers through the strands affectionately even though she couldn’t make herself look at his face. The night had been chaotic, rumbling, flashing as she moved through it, almost watching herself and her body from somewhere else. She doesn’t really know how she got here.
‘Let me wash your back,’ smirking. She washed his too. If she buried her head in his shoulder, he could be anyone. She could only smell her own shampoo and the steam of hot water. As he dried her hair, rubbing the locks carefully, tenderly like that, she almost felt like she loved him.
Her makeup had to be running. While he dried off she turned towards the mirror. Her cheeks were still rouged, mascara defiantly in place. Her face was just the same as when she left for the night. She remembered–the tube had said waterproof.

*

	Paris pants, finishes her last lap. Her coach slaps her on the shoulder, handing her a water bottle. “Nice,” he says. “How’s that Achilles feel?”
	Paris shrugs. She’s been injured for months now and doesn’t even remember what it’s like to run her best. She might quit next year–she envies the free time Tara and Annabelle have. She changes in the locker room methodically, mostly ignoring her teammates. They all have x’s now. She didn’t expect it to catch on so quickly but it makes her happy for some reason.
It’s Friday, not that that means anything these days. No one has gone out since the letter came out three weeks ago. Wine night with the girls, again, is in her future. She wonders what the guys have been up to. Probably playing sad games of pong and chugging warm beer by themselves. Paris doesn’t get why people don’t want to just go out and dance. X’s don’t mean you can’t dance. When she said so to Tara and Annabelle last week they just stared at her.
	Her phone buzzes. A text from Tara. Party tonight.

*

He kissed my knee once. He was bent down tying my shoes like he always did after we finished, and then he just turned his head and did it. I held onto that for a long time.

*

	Crystal strides into the dorm, heading straight for the common room. Tara had texted her to come. The lights are dimmed and it takes Crystal a minute to find her in a corner standing with Annabelle and Paris. “So this is what it’s come to?” she asks.
	A few weeks ago, she would have come to a party like this and seen people gathered around pong tables, sitting on ledges, mingling while half dancing to too-loud music. Tonight, the room is silent. And divided–on one side, the guys swallow beer and talk, backs to the girls, though every so often one will glance over their shoulder. The girls on the other side do the same, though they clutch more hard seltzers than beers. Crystal sees, of all people, Dan emerge from his circle, walking to the center of the room. Something propels her forward, shaking Tara’s hand off her shoulder.
	Dan smirks. “You.”
	“And you,” she purrs.
        When his lips touch hers, the warmth that courses through her body distracts her. They sink to their knees, hands grabbing haphazardly. When they come up for air, she comes back down to earth, embarrassed. She is not one for PDA. But then she looks away and sees that all around her people are in pairs, going at it right then and there. Paris and Nick. Josie and Bryce. Lawson and Ellie. Ben and Lucy. Annabelle and Garrett. Tate and… that can’t be right. It’s dark in here. Tara must have left with someone. Crystal looks back at Dan. She falls back into his mouth and doesn’t come out.

*

When I decided to go celibate, it wasn’t the first time. I declared abstinence the second month of freshman year when this guy I sucked off in the woods started dating this girl the literal next day. I really liked the guy too. Ha. That time it was blurted out in front of friends I’d been trying to impress and I had to follow up on my word. I lasted like a week.

*

	Tara bursts into her room, shutting the door with her back and sliding down to the floor. This is wrong. She wants to cry. She shuts her eyes and wills a tear to fall, just one. Instead, to her horror, a giggle rises in her throat. She swallows, but it bubbles over, and now she’s laughing hysterically. What a fucking shitshow.
	She yanks open the second drawer of her desk, where she keeps the junk she never uses, searching. She had protested when her mom tucked the miniature sewing kit in her boxes for college. As if she’d ever hem a skirt or sew on a button in between classes. Now she was glad that she had it. It was clearer than ever what she had to do. Everyone thinks this is some big joke, and now everything’s just going to go back to the way it was. Nothing would change. She has to do something drastic. She shoves aside a white sheet and fishes the kit out from under a flier for the career fair.
        Tara lays a towel in front of the floor length mirror and unbuttons her jeans. She doesn’t bother to lock the door–Annabelle’s not coming home anytime soon. Peeling off her underwear, she hesitates before throwing it into her laundry basket, instead bunching it up and shoving it into her mouth. Spreading her legs, she realizes she’s never looked at herself up close like that. It doesn’t look anything like a flower. It’s pretty disgusting looking, actually. She threads the needle. Beads of sweat blaze trails down her temples as she bites down. She pinches her lips together and makes the first stitch.

*

It’s been 11 weeks now, bordering on unbearable. She’d assumed the anger, the loneliness, the crippling humiliation and all that would have faded somewhat by now. She could just text him and ask to talk–all she really needs is an explanation. He’d probably say yes, too. But she’s not quite convinced this isn’t just another one of their ‘I bet I care less than you’ competitions.
And she will not lose.

    <string name="allyT">Not My Mothers Recipe</string>
    <string name="allyS">
        "
Apples hold a sort of perfection I don’t understand. Not even the bruises on their peel can dull the enticing juices inside. When I was a kid I would carefully use my sharpest knife to slice through the bright red peel and dull yellow streaks decorating its round body. Habitually and discreetly I washed the knife and cutting board, making sure to slowly turn on the faucet just enough so that my mother didn’t wake up to my midnight snacking. Every time I had a hankering for apples it was always at midnight and every time it woke my mother up and she stormed into the kitchen wearing her robin blue robe and a scrunched-up face that almost made me wince, but she wasn’t here to scowl at me anymore.

*

Carefully I slice right through the center of the last Honeycrisp apple I need for my pie. This is my first time following one of my mother’s recipes. Supposedly she made the town’s best apple crumble pie; I wouldn’t know. I’ve only just begun the process but I’ve already messed up. Yesterday afternoon I scoured the grocery store for granny smith apples, just like the recipe calls for, but I couldn’t find any, so I settled on Honeycrisp. They’re my favorite apple, but it’s not what my mother would have used. I figured it would be fine either way; it’s not like she’s eating it.
I gather granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and lemon onto the counter. As I’m about to dip my measuring cup into the freshly opened bag of sugar, Sofie starts running up to me. Her dark brown curls, always messy just like mine, bob up and down as she makes her way across the living room and into the kitchen. Her sweet, red cheeks rise up into a smile right before she babbles, “I want to help.”
I softly smile back at her and admire her eagerness to help me complete such a mundane task. Scooping out ½ a cup of sugar isn’t exactly what most three-year-olds get excited about, but Sofie always wants to help. In fact, Sofie is my clingiest child, she always wants to be where I am, and do what I’m doing. If I’m being honest, sometimes she doesn’t know boundaries. Last week I got stuck in traffic for half an hour on the way home after chugging a large coffee. The first thing I wanted to do as soon as I opened the door was a dash to the bathroom, but as always Sofie was right behind me. So instead of having a minute to myself so I could pee, I had to urinate with the door open and with Sofie’s big brown eyes staring right at me. I won’t lie, at that moment I was really annoyed. For once I just wanted to do something simply by myself without a kid pulling at my legs and begging for attention, but I love Sofie and I love that she always wants to be with me.
I pick Sofie up and hand her the measuring cup, fully expecting her to spill sugar everywhere, like she always does when she helps me cook, but surprisingly enough she manages to get most of the sugar into the bowl and only a bit on herself.
“Thank you for helping me, the pie is gonna be so much better now.”
“But I spilled.”
“That’s okay, I like it when you help me.“

*

I never noticed when my mother’s face became so wrinkly. When my memories play back she goes from being a young, vibrant red-head to a pudgy, apple-faced woman with streaks of grey running between her faded box-dyed strands. I wish I could know what aged her so quickly but I’m often afraid if I reflect too closely on her shortcomings I’ll be holding a mirror up to myself.
As a teen, I spent my days wondering who my mother was when she was my age. I ached to know what her dreams were and what she wore. But I never found out. We were never close. My mother and I were always at opposite ends. Coming home from school was like entering a battlefield. I didn’t know who would shoot first, but I knew the shots were coming. Some days it’d be my turn, I would glare down at mother and obscenities would just fire out of my mouth. There were no thoughts behind my words, just reflexes as I tried to protect myself from her and her judgment. Other days she would fire first. My mother would load her gun and aim directly at my heart. She always seemed to pick the perfect words to puncture right through my self-esteem.

*

I finish dressing the apples in brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, lemon, and the sugar that Sofie helped me scoop out. I toss the apples in my favorite big metal bowl before placing the ingredients back in the cupboard. When I put the cinnamon back onto the rack the nutmeg catches my eye. Nutmeg could be good in an apple pie, but it’s not in the recipe. I pull it off the rack anyways and reach for a ⅛ measuring spoon to add a little bit of nutmeg. Just a dash won’t hurt, it’s not that big of a change.
I gently toss the apples again, making sure not to spill any, before taking the pie crust out of its plastic packaging. I considered following the recipe and making my own pie crust from scratch, but that would be an extra hour of baking, and knowing myself an extra hour would turn into two hours. I have an annoying trait of turning simple tasks into long, over-complicated procedures, but I’ve always been this way. When I entered middle school my mother told me classes started at 8 am when in reality classes started at 8:30 am. She thought if she lied to me then I would never catch on and my hour-long morning routine wouldn’t make me late for school anymore, but she was completely wrong. On the first day of school, I sprinted through the halls in a worried panic at 8:15 am. Convinced I was completely late and that I was going to leave a bad first impression, I ran through the door of my classroom but no one was there, not even the teacher. Worried that I had somehow entered the wrong classroom—, this was impossible, as I had toured the school 3 times the week before to make sure I knew exactly where I was going—, I looked at the classroom number printed on a metal plate on the middle of the brown wooden door, and confirmed that I was in the right place, classroom number 215 like I had already confirmed 3 times before. The next fifteen minutes dragged on for hours; I spent my time staring down at the desk, reading the profanity boldly etched onto the wood and tracing the outlines of vulgar sketches with my finger. At 8:30 am I found out my mother had lied to me, so the next day I got an extra thirty minutes of sleep and arrived at school at 8:45 am, just like I should have on the first day.

After pouring the apples into the pie crust, I pull the raw crumble out of the freezer. Slowly I pour the frozen crumble all over the top of the pie and pat it into place with freshly washed hands. Sam and I prepped the crumble last night. We mixed together flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and butter, in a medium metal bowl, just like the recipe calls for.
Sam is a lot like me. It takes her thirty minutes to get out of bed after waking up, another 15 to put on her uniform, and an extra thirty minutes to actually get out the door. Her favorite part of her grandmother’s pie is the crumble that goes on top. After Sofie went to bed last night I let her prepare it with me because I knew she would try to sneakily eat some of the raw crumble when I wasn’t looking; just like she told me she did when she helped her grandmother bake the same pie. Recently I’ve been trying to spend more time with her when Sofie isn’t around; I’m worried that I’m not giving her enough attention. Now that she’s twelve I fear that she may become too similar to me when I was young. I hated being a middle schooler; I was moody and insecure and there was never anyone around to listen to me complain.

*

In the eighth grade, I ran away. I had just finished my daily screaming match with my mother and decided I needed to make her worry. I went as far as was necessary to make a scene, but not far enough to cause any actual trouble. I settled on the football field of our local university. This was one of my favorite places in our neighborhood. I would spend countless afternoons kicking around a ball by myself, attempting to teach myself how to play but I never got the hang of it. I walked the same route I always did to get to the field; up the street and to the left, past the small parking lot and the blue hydrangea bushes. For hours I sat hidden carefully behind a tree on the edge of the prickly football field while playing Super Mario Bros. on my pink Nintendo DS. Every few minutes I would glance up from my game to check if she had come for me yet, she hadn’t. I nearly got through all eight worlds before I peeked up one last time and saw my mom’s blue hHonda driving up the street. Her SUV stopped, and the door quickly opened but instead of my mom leading the search party, it was my dad getting out of the car; I knew I wasn’t in trouble. He slowly made his way onto the football field and as soon as our eyes locked he started laughing at me for choosing to run away to a field that took a total of five minutes to walk to from our house. I felt my cheeks get warm as the embarrassment rose within me. My attempt to make mother come find me had failed. Instead, my dad just took me home and I chose to pretend that nothing had ever happened.

*

Gently I place the pie into the oven and set my phone’s timer for one hour before I realize that I forgot to preheat the oven; I always forget to preheat the oven. I set the oven to 350 degrees and reset the timer to an hour and fifteen minutes. I figure the extra fifteen minutes will give the oven enough time to heat up. My mother would throw a fit if she saw what I just did. I check my phone to make sure the timer is running before going to my photos app to admire the picture of my pre-baked apple crumble pie that had just begun baking. The crumble looks good, but the crust obviously looks perfect.
I can never open my photos app without swiping through the thousands of pictures I have saved there. Most of the pictures are of Sam and Sofie. The most recent one is of the three of us snuggled on the couch after I introduced them to The Little Mermaid, my favorite Disney movie as a kid. I scroll past some more pictures of them, which they reluctantly allowed me to take of them on their first day of school, when I land on a picture I took of an old print I found of my mother. She had dark brown curls, just like mine and Sofie’s, big round glasses, and a soft smile I hadn’t seen since I was a young child.

*

My mother wasn’t always angry. At least that is the impression I get from the countless pictures I collected of her from before I was born. She wore the same bright and hopeful smile in each picture like she was smiling at her future self hoping she would look back at these pictures one day when she achieved all her goals and dreams. That never happened. From the day I was born I ruined my mother’s life. She worked three jobs to support us. Every morning she would wake up at 3 am to walk to a small bakery and bake the morning loaves of bread. Then at 7 am she would rush home to wake me up for school at 7:30 am. After I left for school she would go raise the young children of some rich family in a neighborhood we could never afford to live in. At 4 pm she would switch roles again and work as a line cook at a local seafood restaurant until 11 pm when she would finally walk back home just in time to catch me watching late-night television at 11:30 pm and yell at me for not being asleep.
I wonder if it was all worth it to her. I wonder if the countless hours spent in a kitchen cooking for someone other than her own child were worth missing my life. I know she didn’t choose this life but rather it was forced onto her. But by who? Was it my fault that my mother became angry and old or was it her fault for having a child? Did the growing pains of motherhood overtake her?
My phone alarm goes off and I jump out of my thoughts and back into reality. The pie should be done. I slip on an oven mitt and slowly take the pie out of the oven. It sits on the counter for about ten minutes before I get too eager and begin to slice into the golden brown crumble. My mother’s recipe says I should let the pie cool for at least an hour, but I’m impatient and it iswas almost 4 pm, Sam would be home soon and I wanted a slice of her favorite dessert waiting for her when she got home.

*

When I was 13 my mother ditched her three jobs for a full-time gig as a pastry chef in a swanky, up-scale restaurant in the town next to ours where all the preppy kids from my violin class lived. She loved this job. Every day she would spend twelve hours at work baking pies, cakes, macarons, cookies, and any other dessert I could ever dream of tasting. When she wasn’t baking at work, she was at home researching baking techniques and testing new recipes late into the night. Every morning I would wake up hoping I could taste her newest creation for breakfast, but every morning I woke up and she, and her desserts, would already be gone for the day. Occasionally I’d get to taste a bite or two of a fancy cake when my dad would go visit her at work and sneak out a small piece for us to share. My mom never baked anything for me, not even on my birthday. For my sixteenth birthday, she said she was going to throw me a big party. The extravagant party I was expecting turned out to be me, my parents, and some random family members I hardly ever spoke to sitting in our living room and eating a cake my mother bought from Wal-Mart. It was a plain vanilla cake, covered in white icing with the words “Happy Birthday” sloppily scribbled on top in blue icing; it didn’t even have the three decorative balloons like all the other cakes I’d glance at in the bakery section when we went grocery shopping.

*

When Sam gets home there is a fresh slice of apple crumble pie waiting for her on the dining room table. The slice looks a little sloppy, probably because I hadn’t waited an hour for it to cool, but I’m hopinlg it tastes better than it looks. Sam quickly sits down and waits for me and Sofie to join her at the table with our own blobs of pie in front of us. She flashes me a huge, excited grin before digging in and taking her first bite. She doesn’t say a word, instead, a closed-mouthed smile spreads across her face and she nods her head in satisfied approval. Even though I didn’t exactly follow my mother’s recipe as she would have wanted, Sam’s smile is all I need to know that I have succeeded.

        "
Three people are already sitting in the auditorium seats when I enter. I’d hoped I might be the first, but I’d forgotten that actors have “early is on time” drilled into us from our first community theater production. Plus, most of us are suck-ups.
The three students have chosen to sit in the third row from the stage, an empty two-seat barrier awkwardly between each of them. I wonder which of them got here first and established the third row as precedent. If I had to guess, my money would be on the straight-backed girl sitting dead center. And if I had to guess who got here next and decided we’d all be sitting two seats apart, it would be the boy slumped three seats to her right.
My feet thud down the aisle of the auditorium. Theater stairs are almost always just a hair too long, so that you can’t quite walk normally with one foot on each step, and two doesn’t work either. The choice is then between stretching each step in an awkward bent-knee gait, and skittering down two-to-a-step like some kind of small mammal. I opt for the latter.
The straight-backed girl turns and gives me a winsome smile. Too many teeth. I can see her shiny headshot now — typecast: sweet, wistful, love interest. Dies too soon. Ophelia.
“Hi,” Ophelia says. “I’m Hannah.”
I shake her outstretched hand (do college students shake hands these days? Maybe just the theatre majors) and turn expectantly to the boy on her right.
“Jesse,” he mumbles. Surprisingly quiet. He won’t last long here if that holds true onstage.
Something glints in the corner of my vision, and I whip my head around to stare. The third person is lazily playing with a chain around his neck, which winks under the theatre lights. He is unfairly beautiful. His hair bounds out of his head in tight curls. The spotlight behind him gives the scene a halo effect. Like a goddamn Renaissance painting.
I realize too late that I’m staring. He’s smiling, though, like the whole wide-eyed mouth agape thing I’m probably doing is amusing him.
“I’m Sithe,” he says, and his name feels like cool metal on wet teeth.
The remaining students begin to file in, breaking me out of my trance. For the most part they follow the unspoken rules, sitting close to the third row and leaving space between each person. Backpacks and water bottles are piled onto the empty chairs, a shrine to the lives we have outside of this room. Some students talk to each other through smiles, voices shiny and bright with introduction. Sithe chooses to stay quiet, and so do I.
The door swings at the top of the aisle. I wonder when it was closed, because it’s been open this entire time — but I don’t have time to wonder much longer, because there she is. Theatre people love to talk about “gravitas,” and if you asked me to define it, I’d simply direct you to the Professor. There’s something magnetic about the slope of her shoulders, the way her head doesn’t merely lead but commands the rest of her body to follow. She walks down the aisle, and I notice that her steps are even and upright — a far cry from my ungainly journey down. It’s as if the auditorium were measured to the very inch of her body.
She reaches our aisle, seemingly staring at something just above all of our heads, and keeps walking. The stairs up to the stage creak at her in greeting as she ascends.
“Come,” she says.
We need no further instruction. I feel something tugging low in my stomach, and I am pulled up out of my seat and onto the stage. The rest of the class must have felt the same, as we now all blink under the glaring stage lights. It’s hotter up here.
I shift my weight as the Professor’s gaze falls over us. I get the sense she is surveying her subjects. When her gaze falls to me I fight the urge to hide my hands.
         “Chorus,” she says, “is the heart of theatre. Of tragedy. Of art and life. In this class,” she says, “you will become one ensemble, one body. You will live and breathe and feel as one.” A nervous laugh escapes Hannah. She cuts it short, rapidly. It hangs in the air, like an unfinished melody.
         If the Professor heard the interruption, she makes no indication. She tells us to stand, all 12 of us. I am among the last to get up.
         “You will stand in silence,” she tells us. “When you are ready, you will clap as one.”
         A sidelong glance from Jesse. I am sure that for him, too, this game brings up memories of childish backstage warm-ups and chalky theatre classrooms. Hardly the prestigious arts education we all came here for. But she’s trained all the greats, has personally molded the actors we all aspire to. Hers is the name that stumbles out at the beginning of so many acceptance speeches. I have come here so that she will deconstruct my craft, strip me clean of any imperfections, and birth me again unto the stage. From looking around at the rapt eyes of my fellow classmates, I know they feel the same.
         From our scattered positions on stage, we move to form an awkward quasi-circle. I am acutely aware of my hands as they contract at my sides. My pointer finger seizes upon a new hangnail.
         Everyone takes a different approach. The boy next to me has his eyes squeezed firmly shut and seems to be muttering an incantation under his breath. Across the circle, Hannah is trying desperately to catch someone’s eye. When she looks my way I glance down, embarrassed for the both of us. Whatever it is I’m supposed to be feeling, I’m not. The Professor watches.
         Hannah raises her hands in a dramatic pantomime of clapping, and slowly, painfully, brings them together. A few classmates take pity and follow her lead, so the effect is that of a few scattered gunshots. The high ceilings and thick curtains swallow up any echo.
         I glance as subtly as I can at the Professor. Her eyes seem unfocused as she stares into our midst. She has lingered at the edge of the proscenium, but now begins to circle us in lazy, loping steps. A low hum begins to fill the air, and I realize with a start that it’s coming from her. The Professor’s lips don’t give away even a tremor, and yet the droning buzz circles us with her.
         A few classmates shift their weight and glance quickly around. Jesse is rocking back and forth, heel to toe, heel to toe. The humming intensifies — Sithe has joined in. How did he know to do so? I wonder, and yet my classmates have read it as the correct choice — four more join the chorus. The noise is louder now, it grows hard to think.
         I purse my lips and brace to join. By now virtually the entire class is humming, and I feel a growing panic that I will be left out, cut off from the herd. I can feel her eyes on me.
         It takes a moment for my ears to catch my own sound, and another moment yet for me to find the precise pitch notched in the air. But then I do. And my body is filled with swarms of bees that are pushing against my skin to get out, but it doesn’t hurt, no — instead my atoms are vibrating like the strings of a guitar.
         I’m not sure when it happened, but we have moved much closer together. This time, when Sithe raises his hands in one fluid motion we all follow suit. Twenty-four hands build to suspension in the air for a brief moment, and then thud together in a resounding crash.
         The spell is broken. I blink once, twice, three times. I am suddenly horrifically embarrassed. I have the urge to cover my body, despite being fully clothed.
         “See you next week,” says the Professor, a smile tickling her lips. I glance at the clock. Still an hour left in class. My lips part to tell her, but all that emerges is a shadow of the hum, which sounds distinctly like a moan now that it stands on its own. I swallow my sentence and before I can blink she is up the aisle and out the door.
         I walk out of the auditorium with Jesse and Hannah. The world outside seems duller, the flowers muted. Jesse is quiet as he kicks a rock along the sidewalk.
         “Some class, huh?” says Hannah, her voice bright and garish against the dull scene around us. I have a desire to turn and run back into the theatre.
         “Yeah,” I say. “Some class.” I hesitate before the next words leave my mouth, but I have to know if it was all in my head. “Did you … did you guys feel something? In there? When we were in the circle?”
         Hannah cocks her head. “Like what?”
         “Um.” I search the sky for a way to phrase this. “Like, something kind of magnetic. Like I could feel all the vibrations coming from all of us, at once.”
         Hannah stares at me for a split second, then tilts her head back and laughs. Her teeth flash in the sun.
         “God, I knew this school would be hippie granola, but I guess I didn’t know how much! Can’t say I felt the vibrations of everyone in the room, no. Maybe I need to realign my chakras.”
         She walks off, still laughing. “See you next class!”
         I am silent the rest of the walk back to the dorms. Jesse must sense my complete and utter humiliation, because he is also silent. Or maybe he’s just a quiet guy. Whatever the reason, the only sounds punctuating our walk are the scuffs of our sneakers on the ground.
Right before Jesse turns off to his dorm, he pauses.
         “I just wanted to say” Jesse stops, swallows, and starts again. “I just wanted to say, I felt it too.” He walks off and leaves me standing there, motionless.

*

         In the week that follows, I see the other 11 students across campus, almost always from a distance. This is not accidental — part of me wants to keep them at arm’s length. I don’t know if what I felt in class has a place outside of that stage. Or even on it, for that matter. There’s something terrifying about the thought of that euphoria I felt in the auditorium bleeding into real life.
         Once, though, I can’t help myself. I am standing in line, perhaps to buy a tasteless corn muffin, and notice with a start that the boy in front of me is Sithe. His hair climbs in tendrils down his back, across his shoulders. I have the sudden urge to thread my fingers through it. I want to feel its texture on the soft webbing where my fingers meet and use it to scrape the dirt under my fingernails.
         Sithe turns suddenly, and I realize with horror that my hands have already begun enacting my fantasy, twisting themselves into the bottom of his hair. He does not look angry, though. No, he looks at me with something like understanding, and is that — hunger? I turn and run before I can figure it out.

*

         I fast for five hours before our next class. I want to be sharp, and besides, I’m too distracted to eat. If I sit still for too long I begian to feel that terrible, beautiful humming. I distract myself by pacing circles around the quad.
         When I enter the class the first thing I notice is the Professor already on stage. I practically leap down the aisle to join her. I might be imagining things, but I think she smiles at me. The rest of the class quickly files in and joins us onstage.
         Today, the Professor says, we will be counting.
         I nod. Yes, counting. That makes sense. We should count.
         We will count to 12, she says, and one of you will say each number. These numbers are not pre-determined. You will know which number you are.
         We nod. Yes, we will know.
         Begin, says the Professor.
         One, says Sithe, beautiful Sithe, because of course he does. He is One.
         Two, says a tall thin girl across the circle, who says Two with a gentle tapping of her tongue. I smile. We know our roles. We know them so well.
         I am practically bouncing on my feet when Jesse says Seven. No, I am bouncing, we all are, because we are so very excited to be claiming our parts. I open my mouth, ready for my name, my new name, to slide past my lips:
         Eight, says Hannah.
         I frown. I glare. What? Hannah isn’t Eight. Hannah is round, flashy 10. She’s got it wrong. She’s got it wrong, and now she’s messed the whole thing up. One frowns. He feels my pain. He understands. So does the Professor, I can tell, by the small shake of her head.
         That’s enough, she says. For today.
         Hannah shrinks into a ball of yarn and rolls off the stage, unraveling herself as she rolls.

*

         When I walk into the hallway the Professor’s door is ajar. I know she wants me to come in, so I enter. The air is warm in here.
         Ah, hello, she tells me. She does not turn from her bookshelf, which instead of books holds plants of all kinds. Her attention is currently trained on one with small white flowers, which appears to be dying. Her fingers meticulously stroke its browning leaves.
         I can’t help it. I start to cry.
         I know, she says, I know. It’s not fair.
         She still doesn’t turn towards me, but continues to stroke the plant.
         She ruined everything, I wail to her back. It was going so perfectly.
         You’ll have to forgive Hannah, says the Professor. She just doesn’t get it.
         I stomp my foot and pull on a strand of my hair. Well, what am I supposed to do?
         The Professor acts as if she doesn’t hear me.
         What I’ve loved most about this class, she says, is watching you all grow into a living organism. You’ve blossomed beneath my hand, just like this plant.
         But the plant is dying, I say.
         Well, yes, the Professor responds. But sometimes it’s just a matter of nipping a few dead buds.
         And she takes the silver scissors sitting next to her and begins to cut.

*

         We return to class the following week to find the Professor already waiting. She looks stronger to us, more alive somehow. It’s like we can see the blood pumping through her body.
The theatre ceiling looks like heaven. Stage lights twinkle like constellations. We are sure that if we looked long enough, we could see ourselves reflected back in one of them.
         The Professor tells us that today we will tell a story. We will do it by dancing. But before that, we will breathe.
         We inhale and expand, exhale and contract. A heaving, teeming mass. The Professor says we look like a lotus that was cursed to bloom and die, bloom and die. But we are thankful for our curse, for the eternal life it gives us. The chance to be reborn.
         We experiment with how long we can hold our breath for, which is long. When we exhale, the room is filled with carbon dioxide and looks as if it is spinning. Perhaps because we are so light-headed. It is so fun, this feeling of being so close. We are so happy. We wish we could always be like this.
         We hope that the Professor isn’t jealous that she isn’t as close as we are. After all, we are one, and so is she, but another one, different.
         Not jealous, never, she reassures us. She is our mother. We are happy.
         Today we will tell the story of a tragedy, she tells us. She knows we are so very happy, and she loves that we are, but sometimes art is sad, she says. We nod. We understand.
         We will tell the story of Antigone, she tells us. Not the whole story, just one particular moment — when Haemon discovers that Antigone, the girl he loves, has hanged herself.
         Then, the Professor says, he does something very horrible. He hurts himself very badly. And she tells us how he hurts himself, but it’s so horrible that we don’t want to say.
         Whenever you are ready, she tells us, you may begin.
         We begin to sway. It is an act of mourning, this swaying. For we have just found the girl we love hanging from the ceiling of her own tomb. We scream, and moan, and cry. We shake our fists at the sky. Hades, we wail, how could you. How could you take her from us.
         We are angry, though, because there is a fraud among us. A girl. She is pretending, with her too-shiny teeth and her straight back like a knife, that she is one of us. She is acting. But we aren’t acting, oh no. We are living and feeling and breathing and dying. And she is RUINING THE STORY.
         A darkness is filling us up inside, pooling down from the heavens. We have never felt this full of emptiness before. The stars twinkle down at us. They wink like the flash of a silver blade.
         We move in towards her and watch as her body trembles. It’s not to the right frequency, though. Maybe if she would just tremble to the same vibration as us, we would’ve needed to cut her out. But she is a rotten bud. Already dying. Doing her a favor.
         She screams as our arm comes down to her stomach. The scream is cut short, though. It hangs.
         A terrible humming fills the air, and with it comes a searing heat in our stomach. Red spills onto our hands and twinkles under the stage lights. The girl takes shallow, rasping, breaths from the air. We breathe in and out with her, as the ceiling constellations slowly fade from our vision.

A black furry creature visits her sometimes, a cute little stowaway asking for a place to call home. It calls her home whenever it feels like it, and she sees it as harmless, a needy companion that she’s willing and able to provide for. At night, its paws of black static tread gratefully on her chest. It settles into the crook of her elbow and keeps her warm and stuffy through the night. It is forced to move as she tosses and turns in discomfort, but it always finds its way back to her, cuddling harshly into her side. It digs its claws into her ribs without fail as she unconsciously cuddles closer.
It’s comfortable to have a built-in companion. The creature will never leave her, she knows, unless she forces it to. And she’s not sure how to force it to, and anyways it needs her like nothing else ever has. So she finds comfort in the pain, the grounding pressure always against her chest.

She’d never had a ton of friends. She wasn’t too bothered by it, she could sustain herself well enough with passing connections and romance novels. Now that she was in college, though, something had changed. By some stroke of luck, she had actually connected with a couple of people that she liked quite a lot. She’d spent enough time being comfortable with herself to fit neatly into the group without much trouble. She could fade into the background when necessary, and tell jokes when it felt right. They liked who she had silently built herself into, and she was happy to give that person to them. No one else had appreciated her like this before. The group became closer over time, sharing their secrets and learning to trust each other. They gave each other most of themselves, forming one unit that insulated her from the loneliness she hadn’t known she’d been feeling.

As she becomes vulnerable with people that she loves, the creature becomes scared. More and more it has to run away, hiding around corners and watching. They want her, maybe even need her, and she loves it. Her friends can give her more than the creature can, they both know it, and as she becomes closer to the group it’s easiest to pretend the creature isn’t there. The creature becomes jealous. It puffs up its sharp fur and feeds on the negative energy dissipating from her body. It seethes, biding its time to get her back for the pain she’s avoided. It skirts around corners, passing through her life from time to time to remind her that it’s still there, waiting. To remind her that it still needs her, and that she needs it too.
She learns that she should hate the creature. It is bad for her and it is ruining her and she needs it to leave. She tries not to spend time alone when she can avoid it, always surrounded by others or thinking of them. When the creature visits from time to time, she ignores it, trying to convince herself that this is what it means to leave the creature. This is the transition to happiness. She thinks if she avoids it for long enough, it will lose its grasp on her and she will finally be herself. But she can tell it hasn’t let go. It’s still watching her, waiting for the right moment.

She and her friend sat together on the bed. They had stopped crying only minutes earlier. It might’ve been less painful if they hadn’t talked—she was pretty sure their friendship was already over—but she’d thought it would provide them both closure. Hopefully it would be worth the pain. Maybe it was just a way to postpone the eventuality of giving up on the group, since she knew it would hurt. The group had become so important to her life, herself. It hurt even just to think that the loss might be inevitable, so she had wanted to give him a chance. That didn’t seem so bad to her.
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell me,” he whispered. “I thought we were friends.”
“We were,” she said. “But after last week I don’t have the energy for this friendship, and you need to work on your own stuff before you can actually be friends with people that are so different from you. You need to be willing to see outside of your own experience.”
He started to cry again, quietly. “I don’t understand what I did to deserve this. How am I supposed to change when no one tells me what I’m doing wrong?”
“This is me, telling you what you’re doing wrong. I’m sorry, Eli. I don’t know what to say except that you have to accept that.”
He was taking the critique pretty well all things considered, but she knew he wouldn’t be able to change that quickly. The way he’d acted earlier in the conversation proved this. He was subdued now because he had exhausted himself. It was good that she’d been thinking through the interaction since last week, otherwise she wouldn’t have been able to be so level-headed and he would’ve lashed out even more. At least she had mostly avoided it this time, and she probably wouldn’t ever have to deal with it again.
She wished their group could’ve stayed like it was before. He had always had trouble accepting when people didn’t want to center him, and he didn’t react well when he didn’t get his way, but they had all still loved each other, including him. Her friends had been everything for her since she came to college.
Last week at dinner, he had tried to tell a story multiple times to catchget people’s fading attention. When it didn’t work, he’d stood up abruptly and left, visibly upset. They had gone after him only to be yelled at. Another friend had gotten upset and yelled back, and both of them had hurt each other. In her view, the things he had said were unacceptable. When he left, a portion of the group went with him. She hadn’t really realized it at the time, but they were all taking sides, and she hadn't been willing to choose his. He looked back at them before he walked out the door, tears in his eyes. It weighed on her. His tears soaked her heart through.
She’d hoped maybe it would be a temporary fracture, but in the days after the fight more conflicts had arisen and it had become clear that the close-knit friendship was over. The group was splitting cleanly into two, and each side was slowly crumbling. She loved all of her friends, even those that stood with him, but she didn’t think that he was in the right. She had to let them go. There was nothing she could do.
“You know what? You guys never even gave me a chance. I didn’t ever really feel welcome with you, and I don’t even think I want to be friends.”
She wasn’t that surprised to hear it, but the petty words still hurt. She had wanted to do what she could to give him a chance, and she had. It was over now.
“Okay. I’m sorry if I hurt you. Goodbye.”
He looked genuinely upset that she didn’t even try to reassure him. She didn’t have the energy to engage anymore.
When she returned to her empty room, she realized she was far more overwhelmed than she had known. Tears dropped onto her bed as she sunk into it, frustrated and tired and alone. Her mind began to gnaw at the conversation until it lost all shape, a blur of tears and his walls filled with photos and his pained face. She was worried that she had fucked up. What if the friends she still had got mad at her for talking to him? What if she had given him too much of a chance, or not enough? She needed her friends and she couldn’t deal with the idea that there was so much conflict within their once-close group.
After she finished crying, she sat curled up in her blankets. It was all too much. The world was too complicated, or maybe she was too complicated, or maybe she was too simple. She had never really learned how to deal with life on her own. She didn’t know what to do.
Her friends had been the only things protecting her from herself since she got here. The group was the only barrier from her anxious loneliness. Now that she didn’t have the group, she was terrified of what it would mean to think for herself and as herself.

She spent the next day alone, trying to reassure herself that she could enjoy her own company. The morning went well, her windows open and bright with opportunity. She took her time getting ready, enjoying each step. It felt like self care, choosing each piece of clothing carefully to start the day off right. She wasn’t sure what she wanted to do after she got ready, and she put effort into being okay with that. She grabbed a hearty lunch, and ate all of it. She went on a walk and listened to music she had forgotten how much she loved. She was proud of herself.
After dinner, she sat in her room. Even after everything she had gotten done, she still felt like she needed to do more. But there wasn’t really anything that she wanted to do. As she looked around at her room, the loneliness started to set in again. Her mind wandered to what her friends might be doing without her. She tried not to worry about it but it nagged at her as she sat alone in her dim room. Her anxiety crawled up her spine and tugged her down into her bed. She had done everything right today, she had tried so hard to take care of herself. What was she missing?
Once she woke, the morning sunlight made everything clearer. She didn’t have to be fully alone, she still had friends. If she could be strong with the support of her friends, that was enough, and she was allowed to ask them for support. She could overcome the creature with their help. She was sure she’d be strong enough now. She wasn’t going to keep on ignoring it, that clearly wasn’t working. She would face it head on and force it to leave. When she talked to her friends later in the day, she told them about the conversation. She told them about her anxiety and assured them that she was going to overcome it. She tripped over herself with apologies and guilt, and they kindly let her. She convinced herself they were still here for her, that they were not going to leave with no warning. They might hurt her, but they cared about her. She cared about them.
She decided to open her heart to them, and the creature saw its chance. She faced the creature. She could no longer avoid it.

Love cannot come without risk. Eventually she must accept the creature’s presence in order to get rid of it. Only then will it crawl, satisfied, fully inside of her chest cavity, displacing her organs and stopping her from breathing. It will slowly release all of her built up sadness. The pressure will wash over her body and rob her of herself. Once she’s accepted it, the creature will become uncomfortable and loosen its claws. It will finish depositing all of her sadness and decide that it doesn’t need her anymore. It will leave.
She will be alone.

Now without the creature, she cries silently, sitting wide-eyed on her floor and seeing nothing. Her wounds eclipse her and cloud her vision with white. She is full of nothing but her own black shit, and now she can’t even feel it correctly. She thought she needed the creature to leave in order to love herself, to be happy, but she is nothing without the creature. She has forgotten what it was like to be alone with herself, all of herself, or maybe she never knew. She doesn’t want to learn—this was never what she signed up for. She doesn’t know this person.
But it will never leave forever. It is part of her.
The next night, a furry black creature will return through the window. She will welcome it in her sleep, her tight jaw slackening at the familiar pain. Her hands will clench, nails digging comfort into her palms. The half moons will mark her as whole. Together, she and the creature will form one being, marred and incomplete.

She has breakfast plans in the morning, and a feeling of friendly obligation keeps her from canceling, no matter how tired she may be. She can’t be without the creature anymore, so she holds it tight as she makes the walk to the dining hall. When she sees her friend, the creature jerks, trying to escape her grasp. She doesn’t let it. She pulls it closer.
It’s been a long time since she was around both her friends and the creature. It makes her heart rise into her throat, beating uneasily. She tries to quell her anxiety, but it pushes the creature to try to escape more fervently.
She is anxious. That is okay.
She asks the creature if it will stay with her and it crawls onto her shoulders, timid and unsure. She gets a simple breakfast, giving them both room to breathe. She sits down and it pushes itself into her neck to hide.
“How are you?” They ask.
“I don’t know,” she starts, suddenly almost as unsure as the creature. “I think my anxiety has been acting up the last couple days.”
“What are you feeling anxious about?” They look at the creature briefly, and smile at it. They look back at her.
“Not really anything in particular. Just… life.” She feels relief start to build in her chest, leaving room still for the creature.
“Anything I can do?”
“No, I’m just working through it, trying to make peace. I think we’ll manage.”

        CW: mentions of suicide, depictions of stalking
“You mentioned in an earlier conversation I think… that you had started doing daily affirmations, is that right? I think that sounds like a positive step for you”.

Mr. Sharpe sits, one leg crossed over the other, waiting for my response with an expectant look. Every time I visit his office, I envision him as a strict teacher - his bushy monobrow reminiscent of a Math tutor I had a long time ago. It almost seemed like a necessity in my appointments to imagine him as such, as his bedside manner left something to be desired. At least as a teacher, I could pretend that his harshness was a necessary byproduct of his commitment to improving my… whatever I came to these appointments to try and improve. He had initially insisted that I call him by his first name - Marvin - but that would have only reinforced the uneasy feeling I had during our meetings. As though a real person, a friend even, was judging me as opposed to some abstract institution I had built up in my mind. Nonetheless, in light of his numerous flaws, I had stuck with Mr. Sharpe as my therapist for a number of years. I wish I could say that this was because underneath his steely exterior lay a heart of gold that ardently strove to improve the well-being of his patients, but truthfully he was an asshole and I was terrified of ‘failing’ him. Mr. Sharpe was perhaps the only person whom I consistently tried for, embarrassingly desperate for his validation, though that tide was turning.

 	For a moment, I ponder offering the information up easily, but I like to make him work for my responses. I don’t really get my money’s worth if he doesn’t take charge of our weekly interrogation, so we sit awkwardly, the ticking of his obnoxiously ornate grandfather clock punctuating our collective silence.

“Don’t you, Alexander? Would you mind sharing some of them?” Mr. Sharpe finally asks. I nod - satisfied with his additional provocation - and begin to formulate my approach to the delicate process that awaits me.

“I will go back to college and finish my Master’s degree in Finance”. I thought this was a good starting point for us. As a therapist, Mr. Sharpe always had an inclination towards the practical. Whenever I tried to wax poetic about some tribulation or challenge I had faced, he would be the guiding hand that led me back to the bitter cold of reality. Ignore your feelings Alexander - focus on your bills. Why don’t you have a career, Alex? Think about your lack of success in establishing meaningful connections with literally anyone, including yourself.

“I will stop stalking Anna’s Facebook and Instagram and move on with my life.” A compulsory mention, although perhaps not really, as I hadn’t felt the need to indulge in that particular act of self-harm in quite some time. Irrespective of that fact, it was a strategic inclusion if not a necessary one. A balancing act of sorts, I was creating a fantasy for Mr. Sharpe as much as I was creating one for myself - save for one specifically important item on the list. Job, new relationship, eventual family. Mr. Sharpe wanted me to

“Excellent, excellent” Mr Sharpe mumbles under his breath - scribbling away mindlessly on his little notepad. What on earth he could actually be writing is beyond me. These are hardly startling revelations, but rather mainstay topics that have contributed to the bulk of our conversations over many of the recent months. However, I assume he has trouble justifying the exorbitant amounts that he charges for talk therapy if his hands aren’t busy doing something throughout, so I watch him act intently.

 	In more ordinary times, I would have been delighted with his subtle affirmation.  But we were no longer in ordinary times - or at least, the illusion that we had ever inhabited ordinary times in the first place had been broken - and my need for his approval was waning.

“I am going to kill Bashar al-Assad”.

That last one is a little tricky.

Quite a bit tricky, in fact, and the instantaneous halt of Mr. Sharpe’s pen - the sudden absence of the sound of a nib scraping against paper - is evidence of that enough. He cocks his head slowly to the side - his brain still processing the last string of information it received, just making sure it heard me correctly - before his face settles on a stern, piercing stare.

“Do you think this is funny, Alexander? All of the al-Assad stuff?” Mr. Sharpe tuts, rubbing his chubby fingers across his brow before adjusting his thin-framed glasses. There was something slightly amusing about the contrast between his small glasses and gargantuan eyebrows. It was though he was insecure about his poor eyesight and chose to try and hide his glasses, whilst simultaneously sporting his brows with pride.


“I let it go the first time you brought it up and you’re really starting to make me regret it. I hope you understand how serious these assertions are irrespective of whether or not you might be serious.” he says.

	I was serious. Dusk was setting in, and the sunlight pouring through the window was painting Mr. Sharpe’s skin in a vibrant golden orange. And for a moment, I imagine him as a god - draped in iridescent light, omniscient, perfectly moral - and I want to cry and confess everything and beg for his forgiveness. But that was just a moment of weakness, and in seconds, his power dissipates as the lighting shifts and the same old Mr. Sharpe returns. Irritable, cold, balding, human.

“I know. It was a joke… I was joking” I tell him - lying, my hand nestled safely in my pocket with my fingers crossed like a school boy. It was the first time I had properly lied in one of our sessions. I only came here as a last resort, so had originally figured there was no use in being dishonest. However, this was a special circumstance. Besides, I lie to myself all the time, so I could probably save myself the faux outrage.

“Well, it’s not a very funny joke, Alexander. I’m not laughing, you’re not laughing, and quite frankly - I think it’s quite crass and sad that you’re making light-hearted jokes about a dictator that has destroyed so many families” Mr. Sharpe continues, adding to his lecture. “It needs to stop. I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt one final time - but if it happens again I might need to discontinue our sessions and file a report. Do you understand me?”

	“Yes - of course.” I tell him, fully aware that this will be our last session. There will be no next time, no graduation, no great repentance. Not long afterwards, our session abruptly ends and I leave without saying goodbye.

“Hey mate, Ben here from Rocky Road Travel, just wanted to check in with you ahead of the Syria trip big man”. Ben’s intrusion on my evening routine was less than welcome. I had been relaxing on my chair - a replica of the iconic Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman - when my cell phone rang from across my apartment. I’ll admit that I was fairly curious to see who was calling so late in the evening, having not received a real, genuine phone call in a number of years - even spam callers seemed to avoid me like a leper. In a bout of child-like excitement, I dashed to answer it - not wanting the mystery caller to lose their metal and hang up. Inadvertently, I nearly tripped into the noose that hung from the ceiling fan in my living room. Wouldn’t that have been a way to go? I had constructed the instrument just short of three years ago, when I had no purpose in life. I had been sitting naked in my own filth, unshowered for days, slowly using all of the sick leave I had accrued at my job. I was an accountant and it was September, so no one was pressuring me hard to come in - everyone else was enjoying respite from the malaise my general presence polluted the office with. I was watching Two and a Half Men when I broke. I forget what exactly was said, but one ‘joke’ made was so awful, I decided right there and then that I was through. I walked to the garage - still stark naked - and secured rope I had bought from a Home Depot some months prior, in anticipation of the possibility that such a breaking point might come. Not wanting to end my own life to a soundtrack of Charlie Sheen, I randomly changed the channel and - by some brilliant twist of fate - landed on a documentary recounting the Syrian civil war.

	 “Who can end the suffering?” the narrator asks, calling for me.


 	And with that, I was sold. A broader understanding of the geopolitical situation in Syria would follow after years of copious reading, and it helped that I was genuinely convinced of the legitimacy of my newfound passion, but truthfully it didn’t really matter. No doubt, the academic approach remains a crucial element of the strategy I plan to take in accomplishing my goal, but it’s a means to an end. What was most important to me was the payoff - the legacy, the global recognition, the inconceivable bliss of monumentally changing the world - was what filled me with such a sense of vigor and resolve. Chasing that feeling, that unimaginable high, is what gives me purpose and keeps me going.

To this day, I let the noose hang down from the ceiling fan - a testament to all of my failures. Simultaneously, it is both the whip that pushes me forward and the altar that keeps me grounded. I have never been religious, but at times, I have found myself kneeling towards it in thoughtful reflection - thankful for the new path which that evening set me upon. Surrounding my living room’s centerpiece are the forgotten pursuits I had pursued before that night - books on interior design, coding textbooks, even misshapen gardening tools broken from improper overuse. As I make my way to the couch to take the call, I debate later cutting down the noose. A kind of symbolic victory over the evil that existed in my own house, before I rid the world of another evil outside of it. However, it didn’t feel quite right, especially so close to my impending victory. I settle on the idea that, if by some miracle I survive the endeavor and receive a hero’s welcome on my return to the US, I would celebrate my removing the noose then. Regardless, as long as I managed to avoid accidentally killing myself this evening, there was little disadvantage to keeping the rope hanging there. I never received visitors anyway.

	“Ah - I see. I wasn’t really expecting any further correspondence given how thorough our email exchanges have been” I tell him. That the mystery phone call was not from a more titillating source - Anna, Julie, perhaps even an endorsement from the US government if they had caught on to my master plan - was greatly disappointing.

	“Right… gotcha.” he replies. I could tell I had unsettled Ben - and admittedly, my response was a touch stand-offish - but what exactly did he expect from me so close to midnight? “Well, it’s just customary for us to have a little check in to make sure everything is all squared away and ready. You’ve still got your visa appointment with the embassy in Jordan ready to go?” he asks.

“Yes - nothing has changed since we last confirmed this over email two days ago” I reply. This elicits a brief chuckle from Ben, whom I sympathize with slightly in the sense that he’s probably just following some inane internal procedure in order to ensure no one ends up stranded in a random Middle Eastern country. One of the worst aspects of the tour was that I would be accompanied by a gaggle of tourists, who had decided to traipse around Syria for god knows what reason. They would certainly be an annoying distraction, but I was braced to ignore them.

“Right right, of course” he laughs, desperately trying to move our conversation into a more jovial direction. I could tell that Ben was of the painfully extroverted persuasion, and wasn’t used to not instantly winning people over with what he might call his ‘charm’. I’m not exactly sure of where he’s calling from, and I don’t particularly care, but I found there to be something pathetically poetic about the awkwardness of our conversation. Despite being separated by - what I imagine is thousands of miles - we’ve still managed to create a horrible silence.

“Well… what are you most looking forward to? You must be pretty excited for the trip!” he asks me. His tone of voice is sickeningly patronizing, and I wonder if he speaks to all his clients as if they were children or if I was just an especially unlucky victim.

“Nothing in particular” I respond, eager to end the phone call as soon as possible.

“Huh… fair enough, I suppose.” Ben mumbles. His voice was relatively deep but bore a paradoxical nasal quality that bled through towards the end of his sentences, rounded off with an irritating Australian accent. It wasn’t exactly the rugged bass that I had envisioned belonging to the operator of a tour group that ventures through war-torn countries. As embarrassing as it was to admit, I occasionally fantasized about turning my tour guides towards my cause. The average tour-goer, the general plebeian backpacker, etcetera, would not have been worth wasting my energy on - but I did have a degree of admiration towards those who led such people through lesser-traveled lands. Surely, it wasn’t possible for these guides to not hold some kind of rebellious spirit towards the injustices in Syria? In any event, I could already tell that it would be pointless to try and convert Ben - this bumbling labrador of a man.

“Out of curiosity, will you be leading the tour?” I ask, dreading the likely response.

“Yep! I’ll be right there to guide you through everything - it’s going to be the adventure of a lifetime, honestly mate. First, we’ll check into an Old Damascene hotel - it’s genuinely incredible. And then we’ll head off to the Al-Hamidiyah Souq where…” Ben droned on and on. The tour was ten days long, but I didn’t envision ‘sticking’ with the group for anywhere near that length of time. As soon as they let me loose in Damascus, I’m off.

“Just one quick question - might we have time to survey the parliament building?”

“It’s not really something we budget time for in the itinerary, but we do pride ourselves on allowing our guests some alone time whilst in the capital, so you would be welcome to explore the Mezzeh neighborhood if you want. Of course, there’s a relatively heavy security presence - “

“Thanks for the info” I respond, cutting him off. The most dangerous aspect of my mission was how unprepared I was for the actual… mechanics of killing al-Assad. Of course, as an American situated thousands of miles away from Damascus, I realized early on in my research that planning out some kind of grand plot would be a fruitless endeavor. Instead, I had worked on sharpening my creative skills - drawing, painting, writing - preparing my intuition to carry me through the assination. I would try and ask for a tour of parliament and perhaps bump into him, or find him at some kind of public engagement… or something like that. I’m not sure - I’ll figure it out, of course. Heavy security presence, difficulties with transportation - it’s the kind of thing that I don’t want to hear anything about at this moment in time, especially not from Ben. My confidence in my own abilities are resolute.

A few moments pass - “Yep… Well, I guess that’s all for now. See you shortly” Ben says, defeated, and hangs up with a click - a rather brutal transition from the cheerful idiot who greeted me just minutes earlier.

I stare down at the empty suitcase tucked away in the corner of my living room and hurriedly begin to pack.

*

 	The clock on my dashboard reads 2:13am. The windows of my Toyota Corolla are slightly cracked, cool night air gently seeping in tinged with a hint of gasoline. Part of me wishes that I could stay here in this moment forever. Forget about Syria and instead live in the parking lot of a 7/11 gas station, watching my Julie work tirelessly from afar. There weren’t many customers tonight, though I had only been relaxing in the parking lot for 20 minutes or so. Provided I paid for gas each visit, I was able to use the parking lot for up to two hours as per store policy.

 	Cognizant of the fact that this may very well be my final 7/11 run, I try my best to take everything in. The distant noise of the highway, the feel of leather on the skin of my legs, the enchanting neon glow that emanates from the red, green, and orange signage standing tall overhead. A beat-up brown Volkswagen eventually pulls in to get gas. A short elderly woman with a neat pixie cut coloured deep red fills up what must be a full tank of gas, and makes her way into the store. Inside, she pays for her gas and buys some cigarettes and a scratch card. I see Julie’s black hair - dip dyed blue - move hypnotically as she shifts around behind the counter, picking up the customer’s items. The lady pays, and without much fuss, exits and drives off.

 	Conscious of the time, I plan my approach. For a moment, I debate gifting her David Lesch’s rather putrid analysis of modern Syria and the Asad regime entitled The New Lion of Damascus - complete with my personal annotations and corrections. A crucial aspect in understanding the gravitas and importance of my conquest is how apologists like Lesch have enabled the regime to survive and flourish despite the clear justification available for increased sanctions and decisive military action. Had traitors like Lesch done the right thing and kept their mouth shut, I might not have even found my task necessary. In another life, perhaps I would have dedicated myself to killing Lesch himself, but that was neither here nor there. I do wonder if it might be a slightly too abrasive read for our first gift exchange, and I didn’t want to darken her memory of me with such awful work. If time allowed, I might have offered her something a touch more rudimentary and straightforward - perhaps Sam Dagher’s Assad or We Burn the Country, but I stupidly forgot to bring my copy with me. I turn the radio on, using Spotify to loop Badfinger’s Baby Blue on repeat for my eventual getaway, and exit the car.

 	I enter the store gingerly, taking time to appreciate the low soothing hum of the refrigerators - like electric cicadas in the night. It’s a relatively big 7/11 - complete with a separate counter for Krispy-Kreme donuts, though this closes before Julie’s night shift begins and so I’ve never had the chance to purchase one. I take a few laps of the store, purposeful in my steps, scanning the aisles of candy bars, granola, and other assorted snacks. I ponder upon my final purchase, and eventually settle on a pack of Red Vines, and after some further contemplation, a new-fangled energy drink called Pepsi Nitro. The can is tall and thin and emblazoned with a nice matte finish - “Vanilla Draft Cola” is printed across the front in a deep orange. Undoubtedly the attempts of some coked-up marketing execs trying to capitulate on the energy drink craze, I thought that this slightly unsavory combination would be a fitting testament to the circumstances of myself and Julie’s bitter separation. The Red Vines were a staple purchase of mine, often the perfect accompaniment to a late night - or early morning, even - filled with reading. I had never been one for sugary treats, and the anemic, almost floury chew of licorice was the perfect stale accompaniment to my learning. It was routine, a plan but unspoken comfortability existed, just like in myself and Julie’s dynamic. The Pepsi Nitro was unappealing, as were many aspects of my impending journey to Syria, but new and exciting in an uneasy way. I could go on, but I had a feeling that Julie would understand.

 	I wait in line, despite the absence of anyone in front of me. Occasionally, there would be one or two drunks who separated Julie from me, buying scratcher after scratcher - only stopping to grunt about their losses. Julie would beckon for me to move forward, but I was more than happy to let the gentleman take their time and bask in the atmosphere of the store. It felt fitting to replicate that moment in time. Eventually, I take a few steps forward, prepared. Our final interaction. Unless.

 	Julie takes my items and quickly scans them.

“Your total is four dollars and twelve cents, sir.” she tells me, her eyes failing to meet mine.

I count exact change out of my wallet - four dollar bills, a dime, and two pennies, firmly pressing the currency into her hand. And finally say “Goodbye”.

	She looks up momentarily to say “Goodbye, sir” and that’s it. Our exchange is complete. She always called me “Sir” - it was one of my favorite things about her. I had considered that this might only be store policy, but I scouted out 7/11s nearby and found that very few referred to me in such a manner, and she only referred to the drunks as sir infrequently. As such, I was fairly positive that it was a sign of affection. I feel like most of our relationship was communicated on knowing glances and subliminal messages.

I take a step forward, letting my belt and stomach brush against the front of the counter “No… I mean goodbye” I tell her.

“Right” she says, flashing what I think is an awkward grin and briefly making eye contact. I want to hold my stare, but my eyes well up and before I know it I’ve stormed outside - not even remembering to take my items with me. The pain of possibly losing Julie in that moment is too much for me to handle.

 	Upon hearing the closing of the automatic doors behind me, I’m struck by a burning desire to run back into the store and re-do the whole sordid affair. To ask her to run away to Syria with me, to hunt down al-Assad and bask in a resounding victory, to be married by the water wheels in Hama. But by the time I turn around, she has already disappeared from sight into the stock room.

///I plan on making Alexander’s trip through security and what not slightly more eventful, but have skipped over that for now.///

My Economy Plus flight from Chicago-O’Hare Airport to Amman cost me two thousand, five-hundred and eighty-four dollars - excluding tax. Categorically, it was the single most expensive purchase of my life. Despite the hodge podge of hobby items I had collected in recent years - cameras and lenses from failed dips into photography, a relatively unused drone back when I was convinced drone racing was the next big thing, even a decked out computer for cryptocurrency mining - this one journey rose above the rest and came out on top. I had been lucky to inherit larger items like my car and house from my parents, and unlucky to lose them both early in my life, but I like to think that they would be looking down at me proudly. Truthfully, I thought it was fitting that my most significant purchase was the journey that would propel me forth into greatness. The airline was called Royal Jordanian, a fittingly ostentatious title for the mechanical beast that would carry me towards Syria. Besides, it was hard to worry too much about the expenses when I had maxed out a credit card in anticipation of this trip, and stopped paying my rent months ago. Ironically, the first hint of eviction was pushed through my letterbox early this morning, but naturally, I was nonplussed. I arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare before my flight and tipped my taxi driver generously.

Security and check-in was surprisingly uneventful, and before I knew it, I was settled into my seat with a pleasant amount of legroom. I’m somewhat disappointed to find that the plane isn’t equipped with the digital media players that are so common on airlines these days, but find solace in John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces which I had tucked into my carry on.

We take off without a hitch, and after a few hours, I’m happy to see the stewardesses wheel the meal trolley down the aisle. Suddenly, as if I momentarily stepped into a movie, the world seems to turn in slow motion for a few moments as the plane drops a significant distance. Multiple passengers - who had ignored the screeching ‘fasten seatbelt’ light blinking above fly several feet into the air, and the stewardess is scalded as a large hot coffee pot batters against her face. Half-empty containers of beef stroganoff are strewn across our section of the cabin, with several people covered in meat and gravy.

A portly gentleman clamours to his feet, and begins barking French at the stewardess as if the poor woman was in any sort of capacity to begin helping him or any of us for that matter. His eruption triggers a chain reaction amongst the other customers, but before long, another severe sharp drop sends even more passengers crashing into each other. And then the screaming starts, and all of a sudden, I realize what is happening, and I can’t help but be overcome with the purest, most uncontainable laughter I have ever experienced in my life.

	Who was it? Who sold me out? Was it Ben - did my oddness last night tip him off? It might have just been the Syrian government. Should I have been more diligent with my online research, used a better VPN, or a Deep Web browser?  Perhaps even Mr. Sharpe was involved? That fucking bastard. But the more I recognize the extent of the betrayal, the more I come to realize the hilarity of this most grandiose conspiracy. A set up - the whole thing was a set up. Actors everywhere. There were so many tells - the smiles that the friendly ladies at the check-in desk gave me, the suspiciously fast line at security, even the resolute stares of the boarding agents. They had rigged my fucking plane to crash because they’re all in bed with Lesch and all the other apologists. I try to relax, try to pretend this isn’t happening. I dig my nails tightly into my hands and close my eyes. I wonder how often this happens? How often the world is on the cusp of a monumental change, only to be halted by treachery, by sheer chance?

        I look out of the window and see that we’re nowhere near cruising altitude, and instead dangerously close to the merciless abyss of the Atlantic Ocean. Out of the corner of my eye, I notice a woman occupying the aisle seat of our row - we had been separated by an empty middle seat, so I paid no mind to her when she initially sat down. I suppose at some point in the growing hysteria, she had lifted the arm rests that separated us and had inched closer towards me, now awkwardly sat in the crevice that divided the two seats to my left. She appeared to be hyperventilating, shaking, and making some kind of moaning sound as a coping mechanism. If I saw her in the streets, I would have thought she was rabid, but she was wearing one of those stupid neck cushion things and so there was no mistaking where she belonged.

 	The woman looks at me, tears streaming down her face, and tries to speak - but only manages to eek out a kind of wailing whimper. I debate asking her a question, trying to connect with her in some way or another, but I physically can’t bring myself to do so.

 	Finally, she chokes “What’s your name?”, closing her eyes and suffocating under the weight of her world collapsing around her.

Before I can reply, another jolt of turbulence lurches us both forward, our heads violently banging off of the hard plastic trays affixed to the seats in front of us. The lights in the cabin flicker. The oxygen masks drop. The music swells.

        WINTER

        “You’re the only person I know who doesn’t like french fries,” she says, plucking one out of the container on his lap. “Works out for me though.”
“Merry Christmas,” he says, pushing the rest towards her. The car is dark, except for the soft glow of the streetlight shining above them. , and tThe temperature is dropping rapidly in the December cold, even though the engine has only been off for a few minutes. She watches his breath come out in little cloudy puffs as he speaks — it’s innocent and terrifyingly intimate all at once.
“Wait, I forgot to show you,” he says suddenly, gulping down a final bit of chicken tender. “I need your advice on Hannah’s birthday present.”
She glances quickly at the picture on his phone — it’s a gold necklace pendant with a cursive ‘H’ inscribed in the center. “It’s cute,” she says evenly. “Try to figure out if she wears more gold or silver jewelry though, because most girls only do one or the other.”
“No, I already talked to her sister,” he says excitedly, and she’s annoyed to feel the same lump in her throat that she’s had so much practice swallowing during the past few months. “She sent me a bunch of pictures of stuff she thinks Hannah would like. This matches a bracelet her parents got her for graduation, see?”
She stares at him from the corner of her eye — the boy beside her suddenly feels like a stranger, a far cry from the careless, hard-to-impress teenager she spent the summer with.
“What’s so funny?” he asks, catching her looking.
“Nothing,” she says quickly. “You really like this girl.”
“Yeah,” he says, shifting in his seat. “She’s the best.”
There’s a pause, but it’s a comfortable one — she doesn’t expect for him to say anything else — but then his voice is breaking through the dark car again. “Can I be like, really real though?” he asks, and she sits up a little in her seat to look at him. She could probably count the number of times she’s seen him be serious like this on one hand.
 He barely waits for her to nod before continuing. “Sometimes I just wish I hadn’t met her so early on,” he says slowly, staring straight ahead. “Like, she’s perfect and everything, don’t get me wrong. But like, I literally met her on the second night of school, and then we were together three weeks later.” His words spill out faster, building momentum. “I didn’t really have time to figure things out, I was still — I don’t know, I guess I just can’t stop worrying that I’m missing out on things, getting in a relationship right away, and I never even got to experience college without it.”
She’s newly aware of how dark the car is, of the silence surrounding them, of the perfect emptiness of the parking lot, and she stares resolutely out the window, not trusting herself to look at him. Because they’re friends, and friends talk about their relationships all the time. Everything’s normal and nothing is wrong, and she needs to be a good friend. And right now, being a good friend means pretending she doesn’t feel like they’re currently tiptoeing across dangerously thin ice.
“I mean, that makes a lot of sense,” she says slowly. “You didn’t have the college experience you were expecting.” The car still feels suffocating, so she risks a glance in his direction, desperate to lighten the mood. “You never got to have the hoe phase you’ve been waiting for all these years.”
“Yeah, you know it,” he says, punching her in the arm lightly and abruptly turning the keys in the ignition. She jumps slightly at the sudden noise. “Still waiting for you to have yours though.”
“Yeah, yeah,” she says, rolling her eyes. “Keep waiting. Now take me home, it’s getting late.”

FALL

She’s already in bed when her phone lights up, and she hesitates slightly before picking up his call. It’s late, and she knows he’s probably drunk — Thursday is two-for-one night at his favorite bar. “Hey,” she says softly, the blue light of her screen casting a soft glow on her face. “You feeling okay?”
“Yeah, yeah,” he says happily, and she’s relieved to see that he’s safely back in his dorm. “Just calling to say hi. You didn’t pick up earlier.”
“I was in the shower,” she says, laughing a little at his grumpy expression.
“Then that would’ve been perfect!” he says emphatically, waving his hands at the camera. “I know you have your phone in there with you for music, why the heck didn’t you pick up?”
She knows he’s joking, mostly. That he (probably) wouldn’t say that to her without the pitchers of beer coursing through his system. Except for the joke he made two days ago when she put her phone down to change her shirt. And that thing he said about her needing to buy new shorts if she kept up with all the lifting for track. And the routine of talking before bed that they somehow still haven’t broken, despite the new girlfriend. When she walks herself through it piece by piece, it’s all fine and normal, all just on the right side of innocent, but taken together? She doesn’t let herself look that hard. He’s the one with the girlfriend, and he’s still the one calling her, so it’s not really her business anyway — the girlfriend is just a name and a face on instagram that she’s zoomed in on one too many times.
“Yeah, you wish I’d picked up,” she says lightly. “You should go to sleep, you dumbass, don’t you have class tomorrow?”
“Not until noon,” he protests. “And beer never makes me hungover anyway.”
“You should still go to sleep,” she says firmly. “I need to go to sleep.”
“Nerd.” He brings the phone closer to his face. “I miss you, though.”
	“Yeah,” she says, closing her eyes for a minute. “You know I miss you too.” It’s both too much and not enough, and she knows nothing good will come of her staying on this call any longer, so she hangs up without saying goodbye, telling herself that he’s too drunk to notice anyway.

AUGUST, BEFORE

“I told you,” he says triumphantly. “Literally all dogs love me.” She just grins, taking another bite of her ice-cream. It’s the second dog to approach him off the busy sidewalk at the bench where they’re sitting — she can’t possibly deny it — but she’d never give him the satisfaction.
“Yeah, yeah,” she grumbles, taking another bite. “Everyone loves Tyler, what else is new. Let’s go eat on the grass.”
“You like the cookie delight?” he asks, jostling her with his elbow as they walk. She looks up at him, bumping him back with her shoulder.
	“It’s okay. Still not as good as Death by Chocolate.” He looks at her nearly-empty cup and grins.
	And then they’re flat on their backs, laying in the overgrown grass a little ways off the sidewalk, staring up at the stars blinding their way through the leafy trees. “I’ll fully be at school three weeks from now,” she says, shifting slightly to look at him. “It’s that weird?”
	“I don’t know,” he says, more thoughtfully than usual. “I don’t like to think about it too much, honestly. Like, it doesn’t actually help or anything.”
	“I know,” she says, a little bit defensive. “I’m just saying it’s weird to be leaving — everything. And I’m only going two hours away—you’re going to be in fucking Wisconsin.”
	“Wait, I forgot to tell you,” he interjects, propping himself up on his elbows excitedly. “I got my roommate assignment this morning.”
	“You stalked him yet?” she asks, sitting up too. “Let me see a picture.” She plucks his phone out of his hands, zooming in on the slightly-blurry photo. “Why do men never know how to take decent pictures? It makes getting intel so much harder. You haven’t even posted on your instagram since freshman year, have you?”
	“Sorry I never take pictures of myself,” he grumbles, rolling his eyes. “What am I supposed to post?”
	“Post this,” she says, tossing his phone back to him and brandishing her own. He leans back, pulling a face and squinting at the sudden camera flash in the falling light. “Cute,” she snorts, saving the picture anyway.
	“Let me see that,” he says, making a grab for her phone, but she dodges, flopping back down onto the grass. He tries again, snaking a long arm over and jabbing at the ticklish spot on her side.
	“Stop,” she gasps, laughing and trying to squirm away, but he’s too quick, pinning her wrists to the ground before she can stop him. Their eyes lock for the briefest of moments, so fleeting that she’ll convince herself later that she imagined the whole thing, and she’s suddenly very aware of the way their legs are touching, of his long, tan arms on either side of her, suspending his torso just inches above hers,  of his warm, laughing breath on her neck. And then a dog barks in the distance, and the moment is broken.
	“You don’t know my password anyway,” she says lightly, plucking her phone back out of his hand. “Come on, the mosquitoes are killing me.”

SPRING

“What do you mean she wants to meet me?” It’s late, and her voice is sleepy, and the soft glow of her phone light is the only thing illuminating her room.
“When she visits next week,” he says, laughing a little. “What do you think I mean?”
She props herself up against her pillows, stalling a little. Clearly he doesn’t think it’s a big deal, but it’s sending off all kinds of alarm bells in her head. “Isn’t she only coming for like a day though? Are you sure she actually wants to spend some of your time together with me?”
“Yeah, she asked if she could meet you!” he says, yawning. “We can just go for a walk or something, it won’t take long.”
“Ok,” she says slowly, because what else is there for her to do? It’s not a crazy request, and it’ll be an hour of her time, and she doesn’t even have anything against this girl, really. And friends show up for each other. She can be a good friend. It’s normal to meet your friend’s girlfriend.
But she feels dirty and small and there’s a bitter taste in her mouth long after she hangs up the phone, because the request is an all-too-real reminder that the girl who’s the subject of so many of his stories, whose face she analyzes for a second too long in every picture, is a real person with thoughts and feelings and stories of her own. And if she were to think about it too much — something she’s been trying hard to avoid doing for months — she has a sinking feeling that she might come across as the villain in a few of them.

￮

“So tell me more about this guy,” he says, smirking through the phone. “What’s his name again? Jack? Jake? Jackass?”
“I know you know it’s Jackson,” she says, rolling her eyes. “But you’re hilarious, don’t worry.”
“As always,” he says. “But you guys hung out again last night, right?”
“Yeah, we got dinner,” she says. “It was nice, nothing crazy.”
“Nothing crazy, huh,” he says, waggling her eyebrows obnoxiously.
“Shut up, I’m still getting to know him.” She stares at a point on the floor, avoiding his eyes even through the screen.
“So you didn’t even kiss him?” he asks. His tone is still teasing, but there’s a fixed quality to his expression.
“No, we actually just got dinner,” she says. “But  we might do something again this weekend.”
“This weekend!” he squeals exaggeratedly. “Soo are you going to get with him then?” The question feels harsh in spite of his joking tone.
“No — I don’t know, maybe. It’s none of your business anyway.”
“Sorry I’m excited that you might finally hook up with someone! I mean, this would be a big deal, you haven’t even —”
“Tyler, just drop it okay?” she says, more firmly than before. “I have to go, I’m meeting my friends.”
“Fine, fine,” he says, holding up his hands in mock defeat. “All I’m saying is that I want to hear more about this special man.”
“And all I’m saying is that you’re making this into a way bigger deal than it actually is,” she says, her voice perfectly even again. “Is it really that crazy that I’d go on a date with someone?”
“I mean…”
“Okay, okay, sorry I’m not a hoe like you,” she says, rolling her eyes. “I’ll talk to you later.”
She’s the one to end the call, but she’s annoyed nonetheless. Pushing memories of the deeply mediocre evening they spent together out of her mind, she presses send on a cheerry message to the new boy from Spanish class. He’s nice, and he’s smart, and he’s here, and he actually had the guts to ask her out instead of just flirting with her for months on end.


￮


She’s stumbling slightly as she lets herself back into her building, but she’s careful to hang up her coat all the same. The call rings once, twice, then three times as she flops onto her bed, but her face breaks into an animated grin when his face finally pops onto the screen.
“You answered!” she squeals happily, sinking deeper into her pillows.
“Yeah, I did!” he says, laughing a little at the sight of her flushed face. He’s not exactly sober himself, but he’s more practiced at holding his liquor. “So, a big night for you then?”
“Yeah, we had dinner at this Mexican place as our pregame and one of my senior friends ordered me a margarita and then we walked back to campus and we had a mixer with men’s swim and I played pong and I was actually pretty good for once but then I got kinda tired so I decided to go home and then I called you because my friends aren’t back yet.” Her words spill out in one fluid, chaotic tangle, but she grins at the end, her face pressed slightly closer than necessary to the camera.
“Very nice,” he smiles back. “Sounds like a crazy night at nerd school. But you’re home safe now, right?”
“It’s not a nerd school,” she scowls. “It’s just not a huge party school, unlike some other places I could mention. But yeah, I'm back in my bed.” She holds her phone up to show up. “But I had to walk back by myself and it was kinda scary, so I went so fast.”
“Soo fast,” he mimics. “You should’ve just called me, I would’ve stayed on the phone with you.”
“You’re the best,” she says, sleepy all of a sudden. “Tell me about your night.”
“ItMy night was good,” he says softly. “We had a big thing at the frats last night, so we kept it pretty chill. We were just at this bar that has a really good deal on pitchers on Saturdays.”
“Beer is so gross,” she interjects. “I don’t get how you drink so much of it. But I’m glad you had fun. Did you get back okay too?”
“Yes, I did manage to make it back to my dorm in one piece,” he says, rolling his eyes. “I’m a six-foot-four man, what do you think is going to happen to me?”
“You know I worry about you,” she says, closing her eyes. “You’re such a dumbass, you need to take better care of yourself. Drink water. Eat some of that cereal you like before you go to bed.”
“Yes mom,” he grins. “You should go to bed though, you’re falling asleep on me here.”
“Am not,” she protests, rolling onto her side. “I’m wide awake.”
“Go get ready for bed,” he says. “I’ll stay on the phone.”
“I have to get changed though,” she says, sitting up slowly.
“Dude, it’s fine. You’re never going to get up and brush your teeth if I don’t keep talking to you,” he says.
“Probably true,” she mumbles. “I haven’t gotten this drunk in a while.”
“Two whole shots tonight, huh?” he teases as she pulls her pajamas out of the drawer. “Is that new shirt?”
“Yeah, do you like it!” she smiles back at him happily. “ I got it last week. It’s comfy and it makes my boobs look good! Do you know how hard that is to find?”
“Probably pretty hard for you,” he says, smirking.
 She glares back. “Just because they aren’t that big doesn’t mean they can’t look good.”
“Whatever you say,” he jokes. “Can you wear a bra with it though? Because I hear that’s a game changer.”
“Yeah, that’s the best part!” she gushes.
“Let me see,” he grins. If she were sober, she would laugh the comment off, or maybe even tell him to get lost, but she’s still floating on her happy cloud of margaritas and seltzers and laughter and night air, so she grins back at him and prances across the room to the full length mirror. All her doubts, her hesitations and suspicions, and the ever-growing voices in her head that sound suspiciously like her friends and her conscience, are being held at bay by the alcohol. And in that moment she decides that all of this is normal, that of course friends can get changed in front of each other, that it’s only natural he’d ask to see her bra too, that he’d tell her he liked it and that it did make her boobs look good (it is a nice bra, after all) and that nothing is wrong with the situation at all. That he was the best friend she could ever ask for. But she cries a little in the morning all the same, when she’s left to wake up alone with a dry mouth and a headache and the new shirt thrown over the back of her desk chair.

AUGUST BEFORE, AGAIN

She doesn’t know why she lies. It’s not like her parents wouldn’t let her go if they knew it was him she was going for a drive with. They probably wouldn’t even ask her too many awkward questions. But it’s just easier, she decides, to say it’s Kate that’s picking her up. They knew she’d technically already said goodbye to him yesterday, and telling them that she wanted to see him one more time would make it seem like a big deal, like a capital-T Thing. Which it wasn’t. She was just nervous. People reach out to their friends when they’re nervous. There was absolutely nothing weird about that. But she still jogs down the stairs the moment she sees his headlights, shouting to her parents that she’s leaving.
“So where are we going,” he asks as she slides into the front seat.
“I don’t know,” she says, looking at him sideways. “Anywhere. Just around.” He turns onto the main road and she turns up the music. “So this is the great driving playlist you’re always talking about?” she asks.
“Yup,” he grins. “A song for literally every mood.”
	“And this mood is Beethoven’s Fifth?” she asks, bemused. “And then Red Hot Chili Peppers, and then One Direction? And then a bunch of really sad stuff?”
“Just trust the playlist,” he says, keeping his eyes on the road. “I’m gonna take you to my elementary school. Gotta give you the whole town tour before you actually leave.”
“You mean I get to see the building where THE Tyler Williams threw up in third grade? What an honor.”
“I never should have told you that,” he says, pulling into the lot. “But come on, let’s go on an adventure.”
She jumps out after him, glancing at her watch. She still has a couple hours before she absolutely has to be home, before she has to accept any real sense of finality.
She follows him around the back of the school and out onto the small complex of soccer fields. “What a crazy adventure,” she teases, flopping down onto the damp grass.
“Shut up,” he says, laying down beside her. “I actually love this place.”
	“It’s nice,” she says, after a pause. He isn’t serious often.
“I always wanted to take Amelia here, actually,” he says. “But we never got around to it.”
	She glances at him quickly, and then stares straight up at the sky instead. In all their late-night phone calls and hours of meaningless banter, they’ve never talked about his ex-girlfriend before, and the moment feels charged. “I’m sorry,” she says, softly.
“I’m not,” he says quickly. “I don’t think it would’ve felt right, actually.”
“But this does?” she desperately wants to ask. “Or is that not what this is at all?” It’s a delicate line, friendship. Razor thin and uselessly, paralyzingly, blurry. So she just moves her shoulder closer to his, enjoying the added warmth in the cooling August air. Dreading the moment they’ll have to get up. They’re frozen in the in-between — of summer and fall, high school and college, of friends and not — but it feels like their space, and she’s perfectly content to stay. And when he finally pulls into her driveway, exactly ten minutes before her curfew, they’ll find themselves paralyzed again by the really final moment of goodbye. He’ll hug her from across the center console, and she’ll lean in to hold him slightly longer and closer than strictly necessary, and they’ll stay that way until a light switching on in her living room will remind them that the car does not, in fact, exist in a vacuum.

        "
	My earliest memory of my mother was of her patchwork heart. It was the first thing I saw any time I looked at her, the misshapen form that sat in her chest, as if someone had tried to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again and then placed him inside my mother’s ribcage. Whenever she held me, I could feel her eggshell heart pounding underneath her skin, slow and steady despite it all. Sometimes, I’d trace the deep scars that lined her dull red flesh, their thickness much greater than that of my little five-year-old fingers.
	I’d thought it was normal for the longest time, until I met my grandmother. My mother worked late sometimes, and when she couldn’t be home, my grandmother would come over to look after me. Most days, I’d watch her as she clattered around the kitchen, pulling out drawers and opening every cabinet as she tried to make me an afternoon snack.
	“Now, where on earth did your mother put the butter knives?” she’d said once, clicking her tongue as she opened yet another drawer.
	I took the butter knife out of the dishwasher and offered it up to my grandmother.
	“Ah, thank you, dear,” my grandmother said warmly. Her heart thumped steadily in her chest as I watched, bright red and perfectly formed. Not a scar in sight.
	“Nana,” I started as my grandmother slathered a piece of toast with much too much peanut butter. “What happened to Mom’s heart?”
	My grandmother’s hand stilled.
	“Where is this coming from, sweetie?” she asked, trying for a smile.
	“It’s just — It’s not normal for it to look like that,” I said.
	My grandmother sighed. She didn’t say anything as she smoothed the rest of the peanut butter on the toast, didn’t say anything as she led me to the dining table, setting the plate in front of my usual seat, so I figured the conversation was over. I sat down and lifted the toast to my mouth —
	“It was your damn father,” she bit out, and I blinked, startled at the bad word, at the venom in her voice. Nana didn’t like to swear, or at least, that’s what I had thought. “All those years together and he tore her heart to shreds, just like that.”
	“Why would he do that?” I asked.
	“I don’t know,” my grandmother said, shaking her head. “He’d seemed like such a nice man, too. Fooled your mother, at least. Fooled me too.”
	“Oh,” I said. I carefully set the toast back down on my plate, appetite suddenly gone.
	“It’s okay, honey,” my grandmother said, reaching out with a hand to stroke my hair. “At least he’s gone now.”
	“Yeah,” I mumbled.
	“Let it be a lesson to you, okay?” she said. “Never trust a charming man with a perfect smile. There’s always something hiding behind it.”

	I stayed sitting in the dining room long after my grandmother had left, frowning down at the dinner table.
	“How was your day?” my mother asked when she came home. She leaned over to pick up my empty plate.
	The question slipped out before I could stop it.
	“Is my dad a bad person?”
	The plate fell right out of my mother’s hand, but I managed to catch it before it could hit the ground.
	“Mom?” I said. I held the plate back out to her.
	“Thanks, honey,” my mother said, voice neutral as she took the plate from my hand. She stood up and walked over to the kitchen, placing the dirty plate into the sink. I followed her, watching as her raggedy heart pumped in her chest, steady as ever.
	“Did your nana say something?” she said finally.
	“Huh?”
	“About your father.”
	I scuffed my feet into the ground. “She said he did bad things to you.”
	My mother sighed, then crouched down to my level, placing a hand on my shoulder. Her heart always looked worse up close like this, the dark scarring and the healed-over puncture wounds that covered the surface staring me right in the eye.
	“Your father made some mistakes,” she said carefully. “But that doesn’t make him a bad person.”
	I must not have looked very convinced, because she reached forward and tucked a piece of hair behind my ear. “He loves us both very much,” she said.
	“Then why isn’t he here?”
	My mother opened her mouth, then closed it. She took a deep breath.
	“Sometimes, when you love someone, the best thing you can do is let them go,” she said.
	“I don’t get it,” I said, crossing my arms.
	“You will when you’re older,” my mother said.
	“But —”
	“No buts,” my mother said sternly. “Now come on, let’s get you to bed.”
	She took my hand and started herding me towards the stairs, but just before we left, I took one last look over my shoulder at the empty kitchen.
	The worst thing was, I could picture it. The tall, faceless man reaching into my mother’s chest and ripping her heart in two, leaving her bleeding on the linoleum floor. My mother picking up the pieces, carefully stitching her heart back together in the same meticulous way she’d sewn back on the buttons I had popped off my favorite coat.
	She didn’t deserve that. No one did.
	As we made our way up the stairs, I made up my mind.
	“I won’t let it happen again,” I said as my mother tucked me into bed.
	“What?” she asked, distracted.
	“What he did to you,” I said, as firmly as a five-year-old could. “It won’t happen again.”
	My mother swallowed. She leaned down and kissed my forehead.
	“Goodnight, honey.”

*

	It wasn’t long after that conversation with my mother that I lost my first baby tooth. I’d broken it on one of the apples that were always offered with the school lunch, and I’d spent the rest of the day showing it off to anyone who would listen, proud of my newest milestone, my next step in growing up.
	It was with this same excitement that I presented the tooth, still spotted with red at the root, to my mother when she came home from work.
	“Oh that’s — that’s wonderful, honey,” she’d said, trying for a smile, but it didn’t look quite right on her face.
	I blinked up at her. “Did — Did I do something wrong?”
	“Not at all,” my mother said quickly. “It’s just —”
	“It’s just what?”
	My mother sighed. She bent down and took my hand in hers.
	“Don’t be scared if it grows back different, okay?”
	I blinked at her, confused. “Different how?” I asked, but she had already dropped my hand, nudging past me to get into the kitchen.

	It didn’t take long for me to get my answer.
	At first, the new growth didn’t look like much, just a little white point poking out from underneath my gums. Sharper than I thought it would be, but normal enough otherwise.
	But then it kept growing. And growing. And I couldn’t ignore it anymore.
	“What on earth is taking so long?” my mother said as she swung open the door to the bathroom. “At this rate, you’re gonna miss the bus!”
	I stood there, frozen, toothbrush still in my hand.
	In the harsh light of the bathroom mirror, my newest tooth looked like something out of a horror movie, needle thin and just as sharp. I hadn’t even realized how big it had gotten. Even with my mouth bared open, it was long enough to rub against the outside of my bottom lip, but I knew well enough not to let it rest there unless I wanted another split lip.
	“Honey?” my mother ventured, hesitant, when I still hadn’t spoken.
	“Mom,” I whispered, voice shaky. “I’m scared.”
	Suddenly, my mother’s arms were around me, pulling me in close.
	“I know, baby,” she said. “I know.”
	“Why do I  — What is —?” I couldn’t get the words out.
	“You’re gonna be okay, sweetie,” she said, her hands warm and soothing against my back.
	“I can’t go to school like this,” I said, voice breaking on the last word. “What if —?”
	My mother pulled back and cupped my face with both hands. “They won’t, okay? They won’t see it.”
	“What do you mean?” I demanded. I pointed to the mirror. “How can they not?”
	“Listen, honey,” my mother said, brushing my hair out of my face. “People will only see what you want them to see. If you don’t want them to see it, they won’t.”
	“How can you know that?” I asked.
	My mother swallowed.
	“Your father was the same,” she said, mustering up a faint smile. “You look just like him, you know.”
	I stared at her.
	Before I could say anything, my mother pulled me in close for another hug. After a moment, I closed my eyes and listened to my mother’s patchwork heart beat against my chest.

	In the end, she was right. They never noticed that first tooth, nor the second, nor the third. Even still, I kept to myself for most of elementary and middle school, careful to keep my mouth screwed shut at all times. Just in case.
	I was eleven when I lost my last baby tooth, but by then I’d long gotten used to the razor sharp fangs growing out of my mouth. When I smiled at myself in the bathroom mirror, the points of my teeth glistened like stars.

*

	High school is going to be different. That’s what I tell myself as I get off the bus, staring up at the vast, gray building looming over me.
	No more tight-lipped smiles. No more lonely lunches. It’s going to be better this time.
	The first day is a blur of crowded hallways and new faces, which is to be expected. I keep my head down and just try to not get lost on the way to my new classrooms. Most of my classes are full of other freshmen who also don’t really know what they’re doing, which is kind of comforting in an odd way.
	The only one that isn’t is my math class. Somehow, I got into the advanced math track in middle school, so I’m taking Algebra II instead of Geometry with the rest of my grade. I don’t really realize what that means until I get to my math classroom and find it full of sophomores chattering away with each other, all the different friend groups clearly demarcated.
	I find an empty desk near the back of the room and sit down, unzipping my backpack and taking out my brand new notebook and pencil case. By the time the bell rings, most of the seats are taken, except for the one to my right.
	My math teacher claps her hands together. “Alright, let’s get st—”
	The classroom door opens again, and a guy bursts in, out of breath like he’d run there from the other side of school.
	“Nice of you to join us, Nate,” my math teacher says drily.
	“Sorry Mrs. B,” he says sheepishly.
	As Mrs. B starts on the typical first-day spiel I’ve already heard a couple times today, Nate makes his way to the empty desk next to mine and sets his stuff down. I try to focus on the teacher’s words, but it’s hard not to get distracted by all the shuffling.
	A few moments later, I feel a tap on my arm.
	“Can I borrow a pencil?” Nate whispers.
	“Um… sure,” I reply. I dig around in my case for a pencil I won’t mind losing and I hand it over.
	“Thanks,” he smiles. His teeth are a little crooked, I notice, just enough to be endearing.
	“No problem,” I say, turning my attention back to Mrs. B. I’d hoped she would take more time doing introductions, but she’s already getting started on a lesson about solving inequalities.
	It’s only a few minutes before I feel another poke on my arm.
	“Are you new?” Nate asks. “I don’t think I’ve seen you around before.”
	“Yeah, I’m a freshman,” I say.
	“Oh shit, really?” Nate says, impressed.
	“Nate,” Mrs. B cuts in, stern. “Were you actually planning on paying attention in class today?”
	Nate winces. “Sorry Mrs. B,” he says again.
	I hide a laugh behind my hand.
	When class ends, I quickly pack up my stuff and start heading to my next class, but then a voice calls out from behind me in the hallway.
	“Hey!”
	It’s Nate.
	“Your pencil,” he says, holding it out to me.
	“Thanks,” I say, taking it back.
	“I’m Nate, by the way,” he says. “I don’t think I caught your name?”
	For a moment, I just look at him, at his crooked grin that matches his crooked teeth. At his bright red heart beating in his ribcage, perfect and whole.
	“Anna,” I say, smiling back, razor sharp teeth all on display.
	Nate’s own smile doesn’t falter. “Nice to meet you, Anna,” he says.
	“You too,” I say.
	The first bell rings, and we both jump.
	“I’ve gotta run to class, but I’ll see you around?” I say.
	“Definitely,” Nate says.
	As we both leave for our respective classes, I smile at the ground.

*

	The first couple weeks of high school go as well as I could have hoped. I make some friends in my classes, I find a nice group of fairly cool girls to eat lunch with, and I get all my homework done pretty quickly.
	Math has never been my favorite subject, but somehow, I find myself looking forward to Mrs. B’s fourth period Algebra II class more than the others.
	“Hey,” Nate says when he gets to class, greeting me with a slanted grin.
	“Hey,” I reply, smiling back. “Ready to learn about systems of equations?”
	He groans.
	Nate’s not a bad student, I learn, just not the best at math. More of a history guy, he’s told me.
	“Thank god I sat next to someone smart,” Nate says, not for the first time, after I help him through some worksheet problems during pairwork.
	“Oh, so you’re just using me for my brains?” I say, raising an eyebrow.
	Nate pretends to think about it. “Well…”
	I laugh and sock him gently in the arm. “Shut up.”
	I’m surprised to find that I genuinely enjoy talking with him. I’d never really had a close guy friend before, but Nate wears his heart on his sleeve, and it’s hard not to like him.
	I almost want to tell him to be more careful. That the world’s not a safe place for people who don’t know how to protect their hearts.
	But I don’t.
	The bell rings, and everyone starts packing up their things to leave.
	“Don’t forget, our first unit test is on Friday!” Mrs. B calls over the sound of shuffling notebooks.
	“Ugh,” Nate grimaces. “I should probably start studying, huh?”
	“Do you want to study together?” my mouth says for me.
	Nate blinks up at me. “Are — are you sure? I’d probably just slow you down, honestly.”
“It’s okay,” I say. “Teaching other people helps me a lot, too.”
	“Then… yeah, I’d love to,” Nate grins, wide.
	“Cool,” I say, smiling back. “Let me know when you’re free.”
	It turns out Nate is free right after school most days, so we end up in the library at 3:00 the day after, working on Mrs. B’s study guides together. It’s not a bad way to spend an afternoon, all things considered.
	“We should do this again,” Nate says, after.
	“We won’t always have tests to study for, though,” I point out.
	“We can just work on homework or something,” Nate says quickly. “Unless — Unless you don’t want to.”
	I think about it for a moment.
	“How about we trade?” I say. “You help me with history, and I help you with math.”
	Nate’s mouth quirks up in that same crooked smile. “Having trouble in APUSH, are you?”
	“It’s only because I have Rhodes,” I say, rolling my eyes. “I swear she takes points off just because she wants to.”
	“Oh, yeah, she’s tough,” Nate agrees.
	“So what do you say?”
	Nate grins. “It’s a deal.”

	“You’re back late today,” my mother remarks when I get home, fresh off of the late bus.
	“I was studying with a friend,” I say.
	“A friend, huh?” she says, raising her eyebrows. “You’re smiling awfully big, Anna.”
	My hand flies to my mouth automatically. “No I’m not,” I say.
	My mother shakes her head, fondly exasperated. “Just be careful, okay?”
	“I always am,” I say, quiet.
	My mother’s heart has healed over the years, and the scars aren’t quite so stark anymore. But I don’t think they’ll ever go away.

*

	It’s a couple months into the semester when my friend Katie leans over the lunch table.
	“Did you guys hear?” she says. “Jake Warren is having a party on Saturday.
	I take a bite of my sandwich. “Doesn’t he have one every Saturday?”
	On my right, Claire laughs. “Yeah, I heard his parents don’t care about him messing the whole place up.”
	Katie makes an impatient noise. “Okay, yeah, he has a lot of parties, but the difference is that this time, I convinced my older sister to let us come with her. You’re welcome.”
	“Are his parties even fun though?” Claire asks, uncertain.
	“Of course they are!” Katie says.
	“Have you ever gone?” I ask.
	“Well, no, but my sister tells me all about it,” Katie says. “They’re fun, I promise. Come on, you guys can’t just leave me to go on my own!”
	“You’ll still have your sister,” I point out.
	“Okay, but that’s not the same,” Katie whines. “Come on, please?”
	Which is to say, that’s how I end up crammed in Katie’s sister’s car that next Saturday night. I wasn’t able to muster up the courage to ask my mother for permission, so instead, I opt to sneak out, as quiet and careful as I can, adrenaline spiking at every little noise. My heart is still racing as I sit in the car, head leaning against the cold glass of the car window.
	“Thanks for driving us, Phoebe,” Claire says.
	Katie’s sister snorts. “Just don’t drink too much, alright? No one wants to take care of puking freshmen, especially not me.”
	It’s a short drive, and before long, Phoebe’s pulling into the driveway.
	“We’re here,” Katie says, nervous. “Shit.”
	“Just follow my lead, okay guys?” Phoebe says as she takes her keys out the ignition and opens the driver side door.
	I do as Phoebe says, following her up the driveway and to the front door. Phoebe doesn’t bother knocking, just opens the door and walks in, so I do the same.
	Katie looks around, head on a swivel. “I don’t really see any —”
	“Yeah, no shit, everyone’s in the basement,” Phoebe says, rolling her eyes. “Come on.”
	As soon as Phoebe opens the basement door, the obnoxiously loud music washes over me, as well as the smell of weed. I wrinkle my nose, but I follow her down, Claire and Katie close behind me.
	The basement is dark, lit only by some colored LED lights. The stretch of wide open space in front of the stairs is packed with people dancing to the music. To the right is a much less crowded area, with some couches and a ping-pong table that’s been turned into a beer pong table.
	“Pheebs! You made it!” a nearby guy exclaims. “And you brought…”
	“My sister and some of her friends,” Phoebe says.
	“Oh… of course!” the guy says. “Lemme grab you guys some drinks.”
	A few minutes later, Katie, Claire, and I have all acquired a can of hard seltzer each.
	“Don’t do anything dumb!” Phoebe says one last time before disappearing into the crowd with her friend.
	After a moment, Katie, Claire, and I all exchange glances.
	“Some party, huh?” I say.
	Katie scowls. “We just got here, Anna. How about we try and have some fun first?”
	With that, she cracks open her hard seltzer and takes a big gulp. Heaving a big sigh, I do the same.
	The seltzer is surprisingly good, only a little bit alcoholic tasting, and it goes down faster than I thought it would. I’m already starting to feel it by the end of the can, which definitely makes me a lightweight, but I guess that’s only to be expected.
	Just then, the song switches to something catchy and poppy, and then Claire drags us all to the dance floor.
	I lose track of time in the hot crush of people, jamming out with Katie and Claire in our own little circle amongst the crowd. Superbass comes on, and the three of us scream-sing the lyrics, laughing and doing our best Nicki Minaj impressions. We dance, and dance, and dance some more, and the time slips by like the sweat beading up on my forehead.
	After a while, I start pushing my way out.
	“Where are you going?” Claire yells over the noise.
	“Bathroom!” I yell back, and she and Katie both nod.
	It takes quite some time to locate the bathroom, but once I do, I’m in and out pretty quickly. I inspect myself in the mirror and try to make my hair presentable again. My teeth glint in the dim fluorescent light."

    <string name="rebeccaS2">
        " After I leave the bathroom, I swing by the drinks table to grab another hard seltzer, but in the darkness, I stumble into someone.
    “Shit, sorry!” the someone says, darting a hand out to steady me.
    I blink. I squint up at the person.
    “Nate?” I say.
    Nate stares back at me. “Anna?”
    “Damn, I didn’t think I’d run into you here,” I say.
    “Could have said the same for you,” Nate laughs. He’s still holding onto my waist. “What are you —?”
    “Nate, what the hell is taking so long?” a voice calls from over near the ping pong table, impatient.
    “I’m coming!” Nate calls over his shoulder.
    “I’ll leave you to it, then,” I say, starting to pull away.
    “Wait!” Nate says before I can leave. “How do you feel about beer pong?”

    “I’m just warning you now, you’re gonna have to do most of the work here,” I say, taking the ping pong ball Nate’s offered to me. “I’ve never played before.”
    “That’s okay,” Nate says, waving a hand. “It’s not like Danny and Adrian can aim for shit anyway, we’ll be fine.”
    “Oh, fuck off, Nate,” one of our opponents says, laughing.
    True to my word, I miss most of my shots, the few cups I land coming more out of luck than anything else. Despite Nate’s trash talking, the other team is pretty good, consistently landing their shots and making us chug the gross beer inside the cups.
    But somehow, we manage to catch up to the other team’s progress. Mostly because of Nate. It comes down to both teams only having one cup left to make, but suddenly, no one can manage to land the shot. We go around in circles, each team trying to end the game, but it just isn’t happening.
    “Fuck!” Nate swears after his shot sails wide. “Come on Anna, it’s all you now.”
    I shake my head, laughing. “I’m not gonna make it, Nate.”
    “Not with that attitude you won’t,” Nate says.
    “Nate —”
    “You’ve got this, I believe in you!” Nate says, voice all earnest like he really means it, and suddenly, I want to believe in me too.
    I pick up the ping pong ball and hold my arm out, aiming carefully.
    I hold my breath.
    I take my shot.
    The ping pong ball sails in a beautiful arc over the wide expanse of the table, landing into the last cup with a watery plonk.
    For a moment, I just stare at it, dumbfounded.
    Then —
    Nate crushes me into a hug, almost lifting me up off the ground.
    “FUCK YEAH!” he screams in my ear. “I knew you could do it!”
    I laugh, giddy with victory and the alcohol. “We won!”
    The other guys come over to our side of the table, and Nate lets go of me to give one of them a fist bump.
    “Good game,” the guy says begrudgingly.
    As Nate laughs with his friends, I grab the corner of the ping pong table to steady myself. The world is spinning a bit too much for my liking, and I close my eyes, taking a couple slow, deep breaths.
    “Hey, are you okay?” Nate appears by my side.
    “Yeah I just — I think I need some air,” I say.
    “Of course, yeah,” Nate says. “Here, follow me.”
    He takes my hand and pulls me towards a side door, and I let him. His hand feels warm in mine.
    The fresh, cold air is a relief from the stuffy heat of the basement. I sit down on a nearby step, and Nate does the same.
    “I didn’t know basements could be like… aboveground,” I say.
    “Yeah, it’s pretty cool,” Nate says. “Are you feeling any better?”
    I still feel a little lightheaded, but definitely better compared to earlier. I nod.
    “That’s good,” he says. “Is this your first party?”
    I laugh. “How could you tell?”
    “Just had a feeling,” he says, smiling. His heart shines a dark scarlet in the dim moonlight.
    Just then, a gust of wind blows by, and I shiver.
    “Cold?” Nate says.
    “A little,” I admit.
    “Here,” Nate says, and suddenly, he’s draping his jacket around my shoulders.
    “You don’t have to —” I start.
    “Nah, it’s fine, really,” Nate says.
    “Thanks,” I say gratefully.
    The wind picks up again, and I pull the jacket closer.
    “I’m glad I ran into you tonight,” I say.
    “Yeah?” Nate grins, all teeth.
    “Mhm,” I say. Feeling bold, I lean my head onto his shoulder. “Things are more fun with you around.”

    Nate is quiet for a moment.
    “Anna,” he says, serious, his heart as inscrutable as his face.
    “Yeah?” I say, straightening back up.
    “Feel free to kill me if I’m reading this wrong,” he says, then reaches out a hand and cups my cheek.
    I feel my breath catch in my throat.
    He leans in.
    His mouth is warm against mine, the heat of his skin chasing away the late autumn chill. I close my eyes and let myself melt into him, my lips parting open to —
    “Ow!”
    Nate pulls away suddenly, hissing. He raises a hand to his lip and it comes back bright red, glistening against his fingers in the wan moonlight.
    My eyes widen, and my own hand flies to cover my mouth, to cover the razor sharp teeth stained with blood. Nate’s blood. I can feel it, the sickening taste of iron dripping onto my tongue.
    “Shit, I’m so sorry!” I say through my hand.
    “It’s okay,” Nate says, sheepish. He touches his lip again. “You’ve got sharp teeth, huh?”
    I freeze, and that same old fear comes rushing back, stronger than ever.
    Did he see? Does he know?
    But Nate’s smiling like it’s a joke, so I force myself to laugh.
    “Yeah, I guess,” I say. I reach out a hand and lay it gently on the side of his face, wiping off some of the blood beading up on his lip. “Sorry.”
    “It’s okay, really.” Nate says. He lays his own hand over mine. “I don’t mind.”
    We stayed like that for a moment longer, quiet in the stillness of the night. I lay my hand on his chest, and I feel his heartbeat underneath my fingers.

    When we head back inside, I try to give Nate back his jacket, but he refuses to take it.
    “Keep it,” he says, “I want you to have it.”
    I pull the jacket tighter around my shoulders.
    “Thanks,” I say, giving him a close-lipped grin.
    He smiles back with that same crooked smile, only marred by the dark red scab forming on his lip.
    ***
    Things don’t really change after that, except in all the ways they do.
    I still look forward to my math class much more than any reasonable person should. Nate still shows up late, flashing me a grin as he sits down. Mrs. B still rolls her eyes at him as she sketches out the day’s lesson on the board. We still meet up in the library for what have become our weekly study sessions.
    “Hey, are you free this Saturday?” Nate says suddenly, looking up from the history paper I’d asked him to edit.
    I blink. “Um, I think so.”
    “Good,” Nate says. “Wanna hang out in town with me? We can grab lunch at that new crepe place if you want.”
    I look over at him. “Like a date?”
    Nate pauses, the tips of his ears reddening. “Maybe. If  — If you want it to be.”
    “I’d like that,” I say.
    “Cool,” Nate says, unable to hide the grin spreading across his face. “It’s a date.”
    “Cool,” I echo, smiling right back.

    *

    The date goes well, as does the next one. And the next one. And the next one.
    On the fifth date — a trip to the aquarium — I turn to Nate as we stand in front of the jellyfish tank.
    “Nate,” I say.
    “Hm?” he says absently.
    “Are we dating?”
    Nate’s head snaps around to look at me. “I — Well —”
    I wait him out patiently.
    “I’d like for us to be,” he gets out finally, looking back at the jellyfish. The tips of his ears have turned bright red. “If — if you want to, I mean. Do you?”
    I smile down at the ground.
    “Anna?” Nate asks, his voice anxious. He turns to look at me again, and I move without thinking.
    I stand up on my tiptoes and kiss him, careful to shield my teeth away from his mouth. No bleeding lips this time.
    “What was that?” Nate says when I pull back, mouth quirking up in a smile.
    “That was your answer,” I say sunnily. “C’mon, let’s check out the gift shop.”

    “You look happy,” my mother remarks when I get home that day, toting my gift shop stuffed shark.
    “Had a good day,” I say.
    My mother eyes my shark. She looks like she wants to say something, I can tell. Maybe she’s gonna tell me to be careful again.
    “I’m glad,” she says instead.

    *

    The rest of my freshman year passes mostly uneventfully. I eat lunch with Katie and Claire. I help Nate with our math homework. I just about manage to snatch a few A’s on my essays out of Mrs. Rhodes’ stingy clutches.
    I take to spending as much time with Nate outside of school as possible, but my excuses start to run pitifully thin, until eventually, my mother politely requests that I invite my boyfriend over for dinner sometime.
    “My what?” I say, nervous. “I don’t —”
    “Oh, don’t bother, Anna,” my mother says with a laugh. “Where else did you get that jacket from?”
    Somehow, though, the dinner turns out pretty well. Nate wears his nice clothes and weathers my mother’s questioning until she’s satisfied.
    “He’s a nice boy,” she says once he’s gone, rinsing our dirty dishes in the sink.
    “He is,” I agree, loading the dishwasher with the rinsed off plates.
    “He’s got a good heart,” she says. “Don’t let it get hurt, okay?”
    “I would never!” I say, straightening up. “You know I wouldn’t.”
    “Good,” my mother says. “That’s good.”

*

    The last day of school dawns hot and humid even in the early morning. Nate picks me up from my house in the morning, still relishing in the newly acquired driving privileges that come with his learner’s permit.
    “Morning!” he says brightly as I get into the car.
    “Morning,” I grumble, still rubbing sleep out of my eyes. “You sure are cheerful today.”
    Nate just hums happily.
    It doesn’t take long for us to get to school, Nate pulling into his usual spot in the student parking lot. I unbuckle my seatbelt and reach for the car door, but Nate stops me.
    “Wait,” he says. “Before we go in, I’ve got something for you.”
    “Really?” I say. “What for?”
    “Your birthday, duh,” Nate says. “Now close your eyes and hold your hands out.”
    “What — Who told you it was my birthday?” I ask, but I do as he tells me to.
    “I had to ask your mom, because you wouldn’t tell me,” Nate says, voice exasperated but fond. He deposits something into my cupped hands. “Okay, you can look now.”
    I open my eyes.
    Inside my hands is Nate’s heart, beating softly.
    I stare down at it, disbelieving.
    “I — I can’t take this,” I say, holding it out to Nate, but Nate pushes it back towards me.
    “It’s yours,” he says. “I want you to have it.”
    “But —” I start.
    “But what?”
    You don’t know what you’re doing, I want to say.
    “Anna?” Nate looks uncertain now, the beginnings of hurt forming on his face.
    His heart pumps in my hands, bright crimson and vulnerable in the morning light.
    I swallow.
    “Thank you,” I say, holding his heart close to my chest. “I’ll make sure to keep it safe.”
    Nate blinks, then smiles. It looks good on him.
    “Happy birthday, Anna.”

    *

    [As their relationship continues, Anna gets more possessive of Nate and his heart. She keeps his heart close at all times, obsessed with keeping it (and him) safe. Things seem to be going okay, but then comes Nate’s senior year of high school, and he starts applying to a lot of different colleges. Anna is very perturbed when she finds out that he’s applying to many schools in California, which is on the other side of the country. Nate just says that he would like to have the opportunity to explore more places outside of their little town, but it doesn’t do much to comfort Anna. Slowly but surely, Anna becomes consumed with the fear that Nate is going to leave her forever, but he ends up getting rejected by most of the California schools he’s applied to, other than USC, which waitlists him. Nate is upset by all this, and Anna comforts him, but is secretly relieved. Nate then accepts an offer from a school an hour away from their town and promises to come visit often.]

    *

    “It’s such a nice day,” I remark, lying on my back in the grass. It’s May, and spring has finally seemed to settle down, the warm sun teasing me with hints of summer.
    Nate, lying beside me, doesn’t say anything.
    “Nate?”
    “Huh?” he says, distracted. “Sorry, what’d you say?”
    I turn to look at him, frowning. “Is there something on your mind?”
    “Why would you say that?” Nate says quickly.
    “You’ve been distracted all day,” I say.
    Nate sighs. He sits up and turns to me.
    “I guess — I need to talk to you,” he says.
    I sit up quickly. “About what?”
    Nate is quiet for a long moment.
    “You know how I was waitlisted for USC?” he says, and the world drops out from underneath me.
    “Yeah?” I somehow manage to get out.
    “Well, they sent me an email yesterday,” Nate says, trying for a smile. “Turns out they want me after all.”
    I stare at him. “But what about —?”
    “Anna,” Nate cuts me off, soft. “You know I never wanted to go there.”
    “So that’s it?” I say, voice cracking. “You’ve made up your mind already?”
    “Fuck, Anna,” Nate says. “What do you want me to say? You know how much I love USC. God, shouldn’t you be happy for me?”
    “How am I supposed to be happy when you’re leaving me?” I demand.
    “I’ll come back!” Nate says. “It’s not like I’m gonna be gone forever, Christ. And we can still talk!”
    “Oh yeah?” I laugh, but it sounds ugly coming out of my mouth. “And how many times have you ever seen long distance work out?”
    Instinctively, I reach for my left pocket, where Nate’s heart usually sits. Except this time, my hand comes up empty.
    My blood runs cold.
    “We can make it work!” Nate insists.
    I pat my left pocket again, then the right, just in case. Empty. Empty. Empty.
    “I mean, we can’t give up before we even try,” Nate continues. “And I think we can do it. Really.”
    Where is it? Where is it? WHERE IS IT?
    “Anna?”
    I look up at Nate. At the beautiful red heart that isn’t mine anymore, beating away inside his chest, just like it was when we first met.
    “I don’t want you to go,” I say, plaintive.
    “Oh, Anna,” Nate says, and suddenly, I’m enveloped in a tight hug.
    My hands are crushed in front of me, and I can feel his heart beating steadily underneath my fingertips. Thump, thump.
    “We’ll be okay,” Nate says, face pressed into my shoulder. “I promise.”
    Thump, thump.
    “You can’t promise that,” I say.
    For a moment, I imagine Nate’s shiny new life in sunny California. Maybe he’ll sit next to a pretty girl in his history class. Maybe they’ll hold hands as they walk down the beach, watching the sun sink below the horizon. Maybe he’ll give her his heart for her birthday, and she'll keep it safe for him, tucked away in her back pocket.
    Thump, thump.
    “Anna —” Nate starts.
    My fingers dig into Nate’s chest, hard, nails slicing through his skin.
    Nate flinches. “What are you doing?”
    Just a little bit more, I think.
    My hand sinks deep into his chest, until finally, it closes around his bright red heart.
    And I pull.
    Nate’s heart makes a sickening wet pop as I rip it out of his chest, broken arteries splattering warm crimson all down the front of my shirt. It beats furiously in my hand, each desperate pulse sending new spurts of thick blood into my chest. The stench of iron is everywhere.
    Nate stares at me, then at the gaping hole where his heart used to be. He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out.
    “I’m sorry,” I say, but I can barely even hear my own voice.
    Nate’s heart pulses again, and I feel the warmth of his love wash down my arms.
    Mine.
    You should have known not to trust a charming girl with a perfect smile, Nate.
    I smile at him one last time, baring my needle-sharp teeth. Slowly, like a self-fulfilling prophecy, I raise his heart to my mouth.
    I bite down.

        "
        Dogs, the title of the game, spells out in blocky, Times New Roman font. It’s emphasized by bold letters that fill up nearly the entire screen—a little unnecessary, you think, as you glance at the image of a dog in the background. The dog on the screen is fluffy and white, and though you have an embarrassing soft spot for both fluffy things and dogs, you still have an urge to throw your computer, preferably out of the window, or possibly even at your older sister, Sasha, who has begged and practically coerced you to play the game.

Sasha doesn’t live at home anymore, but bits and pieces of her still remain: her favorite chair pushed to the side, her large green sweater still hanging in your closet. Or is it Lydia’s sweatshirt? You picture your girlfriend’s blonde hair poking out of the green sweater, and it sits with you wrong, like spoiled milk. It can’t be her sweatshirt. Your girlfriend has never been to your house before, even though she would love to. She would find your home quaint, your mother adorable. Even so, you don’t want Lydia to meet anyone in your family, not even Sasha.

Now that Sasha is gone to college, you have populated the room with dirty socks and boxers, strewn against your uncarpeted floor. The only colorful things in your room are the plants that line your windowsill. During the mornings, you keep a plant journal, even if you’ve already memorized when you’re supposed to water them, re-pot them. At night, you’ve gotten into the habit of locking your doors, flipping the lock until the next morning, until the light trickles through the towels that you have hung over your window, puddling onto your plants. You once didn’t need curtains, but after you caught your mom spying on you through the window from the streets, you hammered a few spare towels from your closet over your window.

It’s a month before spring break, so Sasha will be coming home soon, which means half-heartedly shoving your socks under your bed and trying to sweep up the dirt trails from Sasha’s side of the room. You still have some time left though, which is why you’re playing this god-awful game that only proves what horrible taste Sasha has.

At the bottom of the computer screen, there is a rather uncreative button that reads Pick Your Pet! in nauseating pink words that are made even more awful by the vomit-colored background. Pink and green do not mix, and the only thing that could be worse is if the font was in Comic Sans, which pops up the moment you click for instructions.

You stare at the screen for a full three seconds. You contemplate throwing your computer out of the window. You might even march all the way to Berkeley, on the other side of the country, just to drag Sasha back home so you can throw her out of the window instead.

You shut off the game.

***

Whenever you call Sasha, the calls have always turned into a game, with rules that both of you have never explicitly made but have always followed. Rule 1: Sasha always calls first, and she always calls on Sundays. Rule 2: When you pick up, you’ve mastered the best way to whisper into your phone. Loud enough that Sasha can actually hear you. Soft enough that your mother doesn’t know that you’re calling her. Both Sasha and your mother haven’t been on speaking terms for three months. Whoever calls first loses, Sasha says. You think she’s stupid. You think they’re both stupid, but Sasha insists, and you can’t talk to your mom either, so you listen to Sasha and whisper during your phone calls.

Did you play it? Your sister’s voice comes over the phone. She is also whispering. You check the time, and it reads 11 PM. Sasha’s roommate is probably asleep by now. You vaguely remember what Sasha has told you about her roommate: athletic, pretty, an early bird. Blonde hair that reaches her waist. Her name—was it Abby? Or perhaps it was Abigail. Sasha has spent at least three hours rambling about her roommate, and you have spent at most three minutes listening.

I bet you didn’t get past the home screen. Sasha sounds gleeful, even while whispering.

You groan. Shut up.

What, you didn’t enjoy the color choices? What about the Comic Sans—

You end the call.

A few seconds later, your phone buzzes, and when you look down, Sasha has sent over a picture of her sticking up her tongue. You snort. You flick on your bedroom light so you can send a picture of you sticking up your middle finger.

***

You come to the conclusion that you will try the game again, only to prove Sasha wrong. And only because you are bored. You suppose that you could work on your homework. Maybe. Probably not. There are algebra worksheets strewn all over your table and it brings you back to when your mother would slide multiplication cards on the kitchen table. Sasha was terrible at multiplication. Even though you were three years younger, you still managed to beat her, and when she refused to stop crying, your mother sighed and bought you both plants from the local greenhouse before he came back home.

You would call Lydia, but Lydia is still away for the weekend, her sixth time in Puerto Rico. You can already name all of her favorite spots there. Old San Juan, El Morro Fort. The San Juan Cathedral. Culebra Island is her favorite spot, with its picturesque beaches: white sands, clear blue waters the same shade as her eyes. You have never been to Puerto Rico, but Lydia has shown you enough pictures on her phone. Very-tourist-esque. You told her this once, and she flushed pink and refused to speak to you for the rest of the day.

When you log into the game this time, you brave through the awful color schemes and the horrifying choice of fonts, and click the Pick Your Pet button. The screen fades to black. A wheel appears. Instead of numbers, there are images of dogs plastered onto each slice of the wheel, and when it begins to spin, it blurs into a dizzying mesh of colors and images.

The wheel is beginning to slow down when your door creaks open. Your mother’s voice slips into your room. Andrew?

You start. Your fingers move. Control, Alt, S. The image of the game freezes for a split second before it blinks and disappears. In its place, a screensaver with a tiny bonsai tree flashes into existence, and further beyond your laptop, your mother stares at you from the gaping throat of the open doorway. She hasn’t dyed her hair yet. The white streaks in her hair glint in the light and deepen the wrinkles on her face.

You ignore the impulse to slam your laptop shut. Your screensaver is on. There is nothing on your screen. Aren’t you supposed to be at work? you ask, in place of a greeting, and your mom doesn’t answer, draws nearer instead.

What are you doing? she asks, peering at your screen, at the bonsai tree peacefully floating in the background. She stays a safe distance away from you.

Lying is easy. Homework, you say. You look at the space between your mother’s eyes and her forehead. You avoid her gaze. Whenever your mom looks at you, you can only see her resigned fear, and it makes you feel strange, off-balance even, like trying to balance on eight tangled legs. You imagine yourself as a human-sized spider. As your mother stares at your fangs and your venom, you wish that you could disappear, spinning your cobwebs out of sight, out of mind.

Your grades are falling, she says.

I know. School is harder.

She hesitates. Are you sure you’re doing your homework?

Yes.

Your mother looks at you. But she doesn’t push. She never pushes. Okay, your mom says, and when she finally leaves, you feel like the smallest human-sized spider in the world.

You get up from your seat to push the door shut, and flick the lock closed. You jostle the doorknob. Locked. It’s definitely locked this time. You exhale and feel guilty for being so relieved. You wonder again why she is back from work so early.

It’s when you return to your computer, that you notice the date at the bottom of the screensaver. Your heart drops. April 16th. You run to the door. Your mom is still on the stairs, and you call her—Mom!—and when she turns around, you wrap your arms around her, burying your face in her back like you used to do when you were younger. Happy birthday—

You find yourself still sitting in your seat, staring at your computer. You hear your mother’s footsteps heading down the stairs, and you hesitate. Then you type in the password to your computer.

The screen unlocks. The game pops up, and you see that the wheel has landed on a dog. It is a white and fluffy dog, the exact breed of dog presented on the title page of the game. The dog of your dreams. You stare at your newly-won pet and wish that you were braver.

***

You decide to take Sasha’s call outside of the house today, a few weed-infested blocks away from your mother’s gaze. There is a playground nearby, and you enter through the front. A couple of kids stare at you. You stare back at the little menaces until they scatter.

Five minutes early. 6:25 PM. You don’t mind waiting. Behind the plastic red slide, the sun’s rays stretch outwards in an attempt to save itself from drowning. You choose a spot on the swings. The black rubber strains against your weight. You’re already too big for swings, but if the kids on the playground complain, you can just step on them. Another kid squashed on the pavement. You try to laugh at the image, but your chest twists. The thought is exponentially less funny than you’d originally thought, but before you can dwell on it for too longthe thought, your phone starts ringing.

You pick up. Hey, Sasha says, sounding breathless. In the background, you hear someone’s voice. Who’s that? you ask, and the phone on the other end goes silent as if Sasha has muted her end. You scowl at the phone.

When Sasha comes back, she sounds sheepish. That was Alice, she says.

She’s still awake?

Sasha snorts. Ha. She doesn’t sleep that early. ActuallyIn fact, she invited me to a party later tonight. I might have to go soon.

That’s fine, you say, but Sasha must have picked up on your disappointment because she adds, we can call another time if you want?

No, it’s okay, you immediately say. I’ll see you in a few weeks anyway. I just wanted to let you know about the dog I got.

You got past the title page? Sasha sounds surprised. Nice. I got a Golden Retriever? You?

The odd feeling in your chest is beginning to subside. Better, you say, and even you can hear the smugness in your voice.

Sasha can evidently hear it too. Wait. A pause. No, you didn’t.

Yes, I did.

The Samoyed?

Yup.

You lucky asshole, Sasha breathes out. Do you know how many players have sacrificed their lives to get a Samoyed?

You snicker. His name is Shithead.

What. A moment of horrified silence. No. No, you didn’t—

You hang up and begin cackling. All the kids who have been longingly staring at the swing you’ve been sitting on all flee, and with that sweet, sweet sense of victory tickling your chest, perhaps the game isn’t as awful as you first thought it was.

***

The game isn’t hard at all. There is no meta for a dog simulator game. There isn’tis not even a multiplayer setting. You stare at Shithead, who tilts its head back on you on screen and wags its tail. The game is surprisingly interactive. When you move your mouse, Shithead chases the white pointer, making yapping sounds.

You end up muting it. The yapping, although realistic, is annoying and oddly uncomfortable. It reminds you of the high-pitched whine of Lydia’s dog. A real-life dog. Daisy, she had named it. A cute name for a not-so-cute dog. It was last year when she had introduced you to Daisy, who proceeded to take a lovely chunk of meat from your arm. I’m so sorry, Andrew, Lydia said, dragging Daisy off of you, as your arm gushed and spat up blood. She doesn’t like strangers.

Lydia is flying home later this week. You already have a bouquet of dandelions that you’ve picked out for her, and as soon as she arrives at her house, you’ll be waiting for her with your wilting handful of weeds. You’re sure that she’ll appreciate the humor. Hopefully.

Aside from the mute button, you scroll through the options that are available, and you also realize that you can gain in-game money through cultivating friendship points. There are multiple options to interact with Shithead—feeding, washing, and giving it a treat.

You close the menu and stare at Shithead. It lays down on the ground and has the audacity to fall asleep in front of you.

You decide to take it on a walk.

***

The knob on your door rattles, but it doesn’t open. You’ve locked the door this time. There is a pause. Then, a knock.

You take your time closing out of Dogs, pulling up algebra equations in their place. Then, you walk to the front of your room. When you unlock your door, your mom is outside. She is holding a plant in her hands. Did you leave this in my room? she asks.

She is wearing her ratty, old bathrobe over her gray pajamas, and her hair is unwashed and greasy. You used to be at the same height, but now, your mom’s head hardly reaches past your shoulders. You wish she didn’t look pathetic. It is an odd feeling. Your mother doesn’t meet your gaze, and you suddenly feel ashamed.

A gift, you say. For your birthday.

I don’t know when to water it, your mother says.

It’s a succulent. You can water it once every week.

It’ll bring bugs into the room.

No, it won’t. You wave a hand at the grape ivy hanging from your windowsill. Take a step forward. See? No bugs. But when you turn around, you see that you are too close to your mom. She is leaning away from you. You take a step backward, and the tension in your mother’s shoulders relaxes.

Sorry, you mumble.

Your mom still doesn’t look at you. Here, she says. She hands over the pot to you. Thank you, she says, after a moment’s hesitation. Then, you watch her disappear down the stairs, feet vanishing first, before her legs and her torso follow. Her gray hair is the last to go, and you watch as the final wayward strands disappear from sight.

The succulent sits heavy in your hands. You press your fingernails into the cool surface of the clay pot, and the hardened surface doesn’t give. You imagine throwing it across the room—clay shards sinking into your plaster walls, dirt spraying in the air, the succulent’s broken, twisted body lying against the floor. You would lift your foot and crush the supple leaves, ooze leaking out of its cracked surface, like pus. Like blood.

You carefully place the succulent next to your laptop. Then, you return to your computer and when you turn on the game, Shithead begins barking again like the egotistical puppy it is. You sigh and give it a pat.

***

The afternoon is warm and sunny, enough that you pass by three sprinkler parties on Lydia’s side of town on the way to Lydia’s house. You contemplate whether or not to ride your bike through a couple of pristine lawns before deciding against it. You have done enough grass-murdering in your lifetime to satisfy even a serial killer.

You’re leaning your bike against the garage door in front of Lydia’s house when arms wrap around you. It startles you. You jerk so badly that you jab your elbow into the person’s head and send her stumbling backward. You hear Lydia hiss, and you immediately twist around. Sorry, you say helplessly, as Lydia clutches her head. She scowls at you. You awkwardly offer her a wilted dandelion that you’ve been clutching for the past three hours. Flower?

Lydia doesn’t look amused. Not the welcome that I was expecting, she says, still rubbing her head.

You stop holding out the sad-looking dandelion and curl your hand into a ball. Sorry, you repeat, as Lydia begins dragging her suitcase up the entrance stairs. You linger behind her. You are suddenly worried. Do you need any help?

I’m good.

Want me to hold open the door?

Andrew, she snaps. You stiffen, and she softens her voice. I know you’re trying to be helpful, but it’s okay. I just want some sleep. She pats your shoulder. She doesn’t say anything when you carefully shake off her hand.

I’ll see you some other time? she offers. She does look tired. There are bags under her eyes.

You nod, and she closes the door behind her.

You stare at the door for a bit longer. Something oozes from your hand, and when you unclench your fist, you can see the remains of the dandelions crushed in your hand. You quickly rub off the sap and the yellow petals, and shove your hand into your pocket, like someone with a guilty conscience hiding evidence at a crime scene.

***

Lydia still hadn’t met your family, even thoughif it’s been more than a year since you’ve both started dating, and nearly three years since you’ve been friends. Not even Sasha, who you’ve complained and joked about to Lydia, but refuse to introduce her in person. She doesn’t understand. Why? Lydia asks, and you can see that she doesn’t understand. I don’t need to meet your parents. But not even your sister?

Sasha is Sasha, you want to say. She is impractical, warm, solid, scared, funny, loud, quiet. She eats bananas and peanut butter together because she is stupid. She taught you how to smile with your teeth, back in elementary school. A teacher had sent a concerned letter home about how quiet you were, but Sasha had stolen the letter before he could read it. Smile, she had told you. The outside world is different from home., and sShe helped you practice in front of a mirror so when you walked into class the next day, you could peel your lips from your teeth to smile shyly at your teacher. With strangers, Sasha becomes the one thing that she’s always taught you how to be, and you can’t see her like that. You can’t.

***

Sasha forgets to call you this week. You wait for the phone call underneath one of the scraggly trees in the playground. There are a few kids who are playing soccer. One of them accidentally kicks a ball at you, and you neatly catch it with a knee. A well-placed punt sends the ball flying back. A few timid cheers.

After an hour, the kids leave. You are still pacing around underneath the tree. The phone stays silent in your pocket.

It’s only when the sun begins to set that you finally head back home.

***
Your virtual dog has abandonment issues. Summarized as: when you log out, the game still has a clock that keeps running. Which means the dog needs to be constantly taken care of, like a real dog. But you don’t realize that until it’s too late.

Your week has been filled with incredibly engaging tasks such as 1) doing homework, but not really; 2) throwing weeds at Lydia; 3) moping at the park, so it’s been an entire seven days since you last played Dogs. When you log in tonight, you find Shithead lying in a pile of its own shit. Black flies buzz around the motionless figure of the dog, and in a moment of panic, you think you had just accidentally killed your dog.

Then relief—too much relief, in your opinion—at the few pixels it takes to animate the dog stirring. Shithead gets washed, brushed, fed. It even gets medicine that costs approximately half of your hard-earned in-game coins. You wish you could tell the dog to suck it up, but there is no in-game option for doing that. Instead, Shithead gets its expensive medicine. Shithead wags its pathetic tail and barks for you to spoon-feed it medicine. You frown back and are tempted to rename it to Needy-Ass Furball, but are too lazy to physically click the rename feature.

Later that night, Sasha leaves a message for you. Sorry about missing our call! Was busy hanging out with Alice, she has typed out, and you stare at the message and wonder, for the first time, how her college life has been.

You are petty and leave her message on read, but it provokes no reaction from her. You stare at her single message for the next three days, and it’s only after your English teacher catches you staring at your phone during class so that you finally type back your response when the teacher returns the confiscated phone back.

Next Sunday then?

It takes her another day to respond. Sure! the message reads, and you feel both annoyed and relieved at the same time.

    <string name="sarahS2">"

        One day, you log in to see Shithead standing above a motionless orange rag of fur. You click on the rag of fur and a box above it pops up. It reads, Skin of Dead Cat. Collect it? The Skin of Dead Cat sells for 300 dollars. You stare at the black eyes of your fluffy dog grinning back at you and decide that not letting it die in a puddle of its own feces wasn’t such a bad decision after all.

You decide to splurge and give your dog a bag of treats that he devours. He spends the next thirty minutes throwing up, and you realize that you need to buy stomach medicine. Stomach medicine is 250 dollars. When Shithead stops throwing up, you are left with a measly 10 dollars in change. You no longer think your dog is the smartest thing in the world, and with that, you officially conclude that Shithead is stupid. Lydia has joked about how clingy you were, but at least you didn’t throw up in her house and demand to drink all of her stomach medicine.

You finish giving Shithead his medicine and watch as he rolls around, healthy again. He really does have more shit than brains, but when Shithead glances up at you with its baleful eyes, you still can’t help but snort. Idiot, you mutter. You give him more treats.

***

Next Sunday, Sasha asks why you aren’t doing your homework. You tell her that of course, you are, and she just hums and says that you’ve failed your last five algebra tests.

You blink. How did you know?

Mom called me.

Mom?

Sasha laughs. Yeah. Pretty odd, right? Even I thought I would cave first.

Did you make up with her?

She laughs again, and this time, it sounds a little odd. Andrew. It’s never about me. Mom’s worried about your grades.

Mom should talk to me, you grumble.

You know it was harder on her, Sasha says sharply, and when you open your mouth, you realize that you have nothing to say to that. She’s worried about you, Sasha continues, softer now. You should make more of an effort too.

After the call ends, you pull the algebra worksheets toward you.

***

You’ve always thought the story of meeting Lydia for the first time was funny. You’ve only told it to Sasha, and she laughed out loud when she heard it. You always imagined telling it to other people though, not to your side of the family, but Lydia’s. You’ve met Lydia’s mother once, who pinched your cheeks and offered to give you cookies. You could see yourself someday telling Lydia’s mother the story. Maybe she would laugh as hard as Sasha did.

Lydia first spotted you brushing a finger over the growing grass in the school courtyard. Didn’t take you for a plant-lover, you heard her say, and when you turned around, she was standing above you with an eyebrow raised. Maybe I was just sniffing the shit, you shot back. She blinked at you, then scowled, and then you realized that she was just trying to be nice.

The next day, she off-handedly commented on your dirt-stained pants and you compared her hair to a display of wilted dandelions, and wouldn’t it be surprising if you washed your hair at all?

The third day: Plant-boy back at sniffing the weeds again, she said, not that he needs it, and you said, Which sucks because it seems like you do.

At the end of the week, one of you cracked. To this day, you swear it was Lydia, even if Lydia says that it was you. But it was that Friday when both of you began hysterically laughing in front of the school, and as the rest of the student body stared and stepped around both of your sprawled bodies, Lydia asked Truce? and you said Fine.

You bike to Lydia’s neighborhood today. You haven’t been talking to her much lately, and it makes you feel odd. It was only a couple of months ago when you both texted each other religiously every day until 4 AM, the glow of the phone screen hidden safely beneath the warm cocoon of your bed. Now, she hardly picks up the phone.

You hope that you can see her today though. You’ve even brought your homework with you—a packet of algebra problems that sits snugly in your backpack. Maybe you can work on some practice problems with her. But when you ring Lydia’s doorbell, no one responds.

When you begin biking away, you catch a glimpse of something moving at one of the third-floor windows. When you twist around to look, it’s gone.

***

The next day, Lydia meets you after school. She still looks tired.

I’m sorry, she says.

***

When you return home, it takes five minutes before you feel confident enough to move back to your seat without breaking anything. Your phone sits next to your computer, and for the first time, you pick up your phone and dial Sasha’s number.

She picks up after the first ring. Hello?

Fucking Shithead, you blurt out. You are too loud. You lower your voice so your mom can’t hear you from downstairs. He tore up the couch yesterday. Shit all over the floor too. It took me an hour to clean after him.

What did you do? Sasha asks.

What if I didn’t do anything? you snap.

Andrew–

You slam a fist onto the table. The phone jumps. Sasha stops.

Fuck you, you say, and your voice comes out funny. I’m not him.

You can hear Sasha sigh. You’re right, she says soothingly. She is using the same voice, back when he used to get angry. It makes the awful feeling in your chest even worse. You aren’t him, she says, and you want to call her a liar.

You take another breath. Your fist hurts. Sorry.

No. I shouldn’t have assumed. She sounds tired. You remember it is Friday. Her Friday nights are the worst—classes, work, parties. If it was anyone else besides you, she wouldn’t have picked up, and you know you shouldn’t have called.

Are you alright? she asks.

You swallow. Nothing, you say. Shithead just sucks.

She doesn’t probe. She just sighs again. I have something due in an hour. But call me afterward if you still need me.

Lying is easy. Okay, you whisper.

I’ll be home in two days.

Okay.

A moment of hesitation. Love you, she says.

Before you can change your mind, her side of the call ends. You stare at the ended call for a little longer before closing your eyes. Your hands are still shaking.

***

You can’t go to school the next day. When you wake up, you stay in your bed and stare out the window until you see the yellow bus come and leave. A glimpse of blonde hair flashes in the sun, but when you blink, it disappears. Just one day, you tell yourself. One day all to yourself. Tomorrow, everything can go back to normal. But not today.

You pull yourself to your laptop and log into the game. You realize that something is different. That aside from Shithead, there are six pairs of eyes that are staring back at you, tiny Shithead-look-alikes, because what the fuck, Shithead has puppies?

Shithead’s a girl?

You spend a couple of hours fiddling around with the puppies. Then decide that you need to sell them, as quickly as humanely possible. You cannot afford to have more tiny demons, especially not of Shithead’s spawn, who, even as a mother, still takes up hundreds of dollars in expenses for eating literally anything. You have to admit that you are a little afraid of Shithead’s puppies. Already, two of them have started following their mom’s path and have started eating the bright green grass you have cultivated around the space of your virtual home.

Each of Shithead’s puppies is around $1000. You contemplate allowing Shithead to keep one puppy, but after the chosen puppy decides to shit on the new couch, you decide that the puppy must go. Shithead doesn’t look that upset anyways.

Three hours later, you are still trying to sell the puppies, and have only successfully managed to sell two. The other four puppies in the litter had shown up to the sale with grass-encrusted mouths, and the buyers (smartly) decided to rescind their purchases once spotting the puppies’ current vegetarian diets.

It takes time for you to grow aware that someone is watching you. When you finally glance up from the piles of squirming puppies on your screen, your mom is silently observing you from the doorway that you had forgotten to lock. You cannot see the expression on her face, and that vaguely unsettles you. Her features are cast in shadow, formless and unreadable.

You aren’t sure how long she is there. You stare back, and although you should be fearful or ashamed or guilty, or all three of those things, you aren’t. You are skipping class and playing games and ignoring your homework, and the only thing you feel when you meet your mom’s emotionless face is calm resignation. Okay, you think. I know what’s going to happen, and you look away, stare at your computer screen and wait for her anger.

One of the puppies is back to eating grass. You watch it snuffle around in the grass, hunting for things that it will later regurgitate in your home. It nearly snorts in a ladybug through a nostril and sneezes. A blade of grass tumbles out of its mouth.

Andrew, your mother says quietly. Come with me.

When you look up, she has already walked out of the room.

You stand and follow her down the stairs. At the bottom, she grabs her car keys that are lying across the worn kitchen table and heads out the side door. Climbs into the car. You sit in the front next to her, and she turns the keys to the engine. It is the first time you have sat in the shotgun seat while she was driving.

Tell me what’s going on, she asks, and even though her voice quivers, it quickly stabilizes, and then it’s just you and your mom. Not a scared old woman. Not someone who you are sure cannot stand your presence.

You swallow the lump in your throat, but the lump doesn’t go down. She broke up with me, you say, and you quickly face away from her, toward the window. In the window’s reflection, you can see your mom nod. She doesn’t respond, and the rest of the car trip is silent.

Your mom stops at a large, glass building, and at first, you don’t realize what it is. Then, the image of the building snaps into place with a past memory. A greenhouse. The same greenhouse that you and Sasha used to go after the multiplication cards.

You begin to get out of the car, but your mom stops you. Don’t, she says. She waits until you’ve gotten back into the car. Then, she leaves. When she returns, there is a small, flowerpot in her hands. A few dahlias shyly peek out, deep maroon swaying with your mom’s movement.

Before you can say anything, your mom pushes the beautiful selection of dahlias against your chest. The petals tickle the bottom of your chin. Please go to school tomorrow, she says, and the words sound more like an apology than a plea.

You don’t—you begin, but your mom interrupts you.

Please, she whispers, and you look at her and wordlessly take the flowers.

You have a good heart, Andrew, your mom says. There is a faraway look in her eyes. Despite her words, there is something still so sad about her gaze, and for the rest of the drive home, she keeps her eyes on the road as you clasp the dahlias to your chest.

***

Why Lydia? Sasha once asked over the phone, a few months back in September. She was still settling into college, and you could hear the background murmur of students blending in with the click-clacking of her typing.

You shrugged. She lets me talk, you said. Sasha hummed in response and you knew that you didn’t need to explain to her.

You’ve mentioned it to Lydia once, on the day of his birthday. Lydia is the only person outside of Sasha that you have talked to about him. You don’t remember the conversation. You only remember telling her that you hit him back, and she shook her head with the stubborn conviction that you love so much. He’s still fucked up, she told you, her eyes serious, and at that moment, that was all you needed to hear.

***

Sasha arrives home at the cusp of when daytime darkens into night. You are sitting in the living room, and the light from your laptop illuminates the room in a soft, eerie glow. There is a shattered pot on the ground. A dahlia. Its maroon petals are crumpled against the floor.

On the screen, the cursor blinks wearily from the familiar pink and green monstrosity. You type in your password, but it doesn’t work. You close your eyes and clench your shaking fingers. There is something wet splashed onto your fingers. You are almost too afraid to open your eyes. But then you open your eyes, and there is a streak of blood on your hands, wet and glistening. You wipe it away on your pants, and it leaves a trail of rust, and the sight makes the back of your throat burn. Breathe. Can you breathe? You’ve forgotten how to count, the numbers sliding uselessly away in your brain.

The password. Focus on the password. You focus on punching in one digit at a time, key by key, and when you press submit, it miraculouslysomehow works.

The doorbell rings. You don’t get up from the couch. You continue staring at the screen, and you hear someone outside struggling with the keys. The lock turns. The door opens, and Sasha bursts through, pink-faced from exertion. She’s carrying a small suitcase that she heaves over into the living room, and it hits the ground with a thud.

I really hate suitcases. Sasha is still breathing hard. She looks around at the empty living room and something on her face falls. She’s wearing a large sweatshirt with a green dinosaur printed on the front, and your throat swells a little. Guess Mom’s not coming, she says.

You don’t respond. Instead, you focus on logging into Dogs. Shithead looks fine. The appearance of your home though is a separate story. There is shit strewn everywhere, ripped bags of dog food spilled onto the ground. Shithead begins barking as soon as she sees you and runs around in delighted circles.

Your dog can’t be that more interesting than me, Sasha says. You can tell that she is slightly miffed. She joins you on the couch and slings an arm around your shoulders. She is warm. You don’t move. She watches you methodically clean up after Shithead.

After a few minutes of clicking, Sasha asks, Are you okay?

Shithead keeps following you around when you switch between rooms. You choose the option to pet her. Her fur is matted, knots of hair tangled together. You should probably give her a bath, so you begin clicking to head over toward the bathroom.

Andrew. There is an edge to Sasha’s voice. I’m leaving, she says, as she begins to pull away.

You stop clicking through the rooms.

Mom tried to throw away my computer.

Sasha stops pulling away. What?

Shithead nearly tore down the entire house, you say. Did I tell you that she had babies a couple of days ago? I tried keeping one of the puppies, but—

Andrew, Sasha interrupts. She sounds strained. Where’s Mom?

You swallow. I left school early. To see you.

And? Sasha presses.

I saw her outside. With my computer. She was trying to throw it out. Shithead is barking at you again, but you can’t bring yourself to look at the computer screen. Your hands are shaking, even worse than before. You wish Sasha wasn’t back home.

Is she still outside? Sasha’s warmth disappears. She has pulled away from you.

Yes.

Sasha leaves. You hear the door slam.

You look back at the computer screen. Shithead tilts her head at you. She has stolen a rubber ducky from the bathroom and has dropped it on the floor. It’s still wet. It slides a little, before coming to a full, soapy stop on the in-game floor.

The white bubbles remind you of hot chocolate foam rising to the surface. The way your mom would always make it when you were in fifth grade.

It was a winter morning, and Sasha woke you up first. Look outside, she breathed out with glowing cheeks, and you pressed a nose to the cold window and saw the sheet of snow that covered the expanse of cracked sidewalk and yellow grass. You ran downstairs screaming Mom! Mom! It’s snowing! and that was when your mom had thick, brown hair, with only a few streaks of gray. Your mom made all three of you hot chocolate with leftover marshmallows that she had hidden away just for this occasion. Is he coming today? you asked, and something in her face twitched, but it smoothed and she shrugged and said, Seems like he’s busy today. Guess it’s just us three, and you and Sasha cheered and clumsily clinked mugs.

It’s a little strange. It had been cold back then, and you remember the mugs of hot chocolate to be relatively heavy. Even so, your chubby hands were steady when you lifted your mug into the air. Now, despite the hazy warmth of spring, your hands have not stopped shaking.

Do you think I’m like him? you whisper to Shithead, and on the screen, she just wags her tail and gives you a large, doggish grin.

The rubber ducky squeaks again. Far off, in the distance, you hear Sasha scream.

        “Will you people SHUT UP!?” Omar rapped his palm on the desk closest to him thrice, louder each time. The class fell silent. He adjusted the papers in his hand, a disgusted, menacing expression on his face.
Rara met my eyes from across the hall, one side of her lips raised, then she quickly looked away. When Omar got to her desk and handed her her exam booklet, she let her fingers brush the edge of his wrist. If he noticed, he gave no indication of it. I did not see her doing this. She told me after we came out of the exam hall, our Physics final behind us, her eyes naughty and full of laughter, jutting her chin out towards where Omar stood on the courtyard talking to our Physics teacher, handing over our scripts, his face serious and folded into itself.
“Handsome,” she said.
“Shut up jo.”
“Handsommmmme.”
“Are you even ready for your Lit final?”
Rara’s face visibly fell and I wished I had not asked.
“Ife, you shut up.”
I pulled my study notes out of my bag and handed them to her.
“You still have an hour,” I told her.
“Forty minutes.”
I shrugged, my eyebrows raised and began to walk away.
“Hey Omar!” I lifted an arm as I passed by him.
“Ife gold,” he said, as warmly as a person like Omar can say hello. I looked back at Rara and made a face, rubbing it in. She rolled her eyes, and turned her back. Omar was friends with my older brother and had been since they started secondary school five years ago, two years before I did. And like most of Timehin’s friends, he said hi to me, called me Ife gold at times, and was nicer to me than he was to other junior students.
“Ife!”
I walked up to where Omar stood by a hibiscus bush, the Physics teacher gone, the flower petals grazing the sides of his uniform trousers. I stared at his thick eyebrows when I got close enough to. They were so straight, two almost rectangles sitting above the deep brown of his eyes.
“You skipped an entire page of your exam.”
I blinked, confused until he held out a question booklet and showed me. I looked with horror at problems on concave lenses and fluid mechanics I had no recollection of from the exam.
“I... I did not see that part of it.”
“You can explain to Mrs Fasegha. She might let you retake it.”
I thought I was going to cry. Of course, there was no way she was going to let me retake it.
I shook my head. “She’s not going to do that.”
He frowned. “Only if you have been a nuisance in her class this term. I will go with you, give you moral support, yes?”
I swallowed and nodded. It was not as though I had anything to lose at this point.
“Thank you, Omar.”
He walked me to the science staff room and patted my shoulder at the door.
“I will wait out here for you.”
I walked in wringing my hands. Mrs Fasegha was a rod-thin woman with greying hair braided up so severely tight that you could see the plaits physically pulling the skin of her forehead so it was stretched and shiny.
“Yes?” she looked up at me when I got to her desk, her expression as annoyed as it perpetually was.
“My Physics exam.”
“What happened to your Physics exam? Abi you overslept and did not write it?”
“I did not complete it.”
“You overslept and did not complete it.”
“No,” I swallowed and continued, “I skipped a page on the question booklet.”
She looked even more irritated.
“And how do you know, auntie?”
I paused. I could not tell her that Omar had told me. The last thing I wanted to do was get him into trouble.
“I was going over some questions with my friend and she mentioned some questions I did not remember answering on the exam.”
“Which of your friends is that one?”
I paused again, but she did not wait for me to come up with another lie. A stack of papers landed on the desk between with a loud slapping sound. The top one had the over-elaborate crest of our school ink-printed in full colour.
“Oya, auntie. Find your own inside and show me the questions you skipped.”
I leafed through them quickly and gratefully and pulled out mine, my name printed on the front page in my neat, loopy handwriting. I flipped through the question booklet tucked into the pages but did not find the page of fluid mechanics and concave lenses Omar had held in front of me. I felt a surge of relief. It was not my mistake after all. Those questions were simply omitted from my test paper. I handed the booklet to Mrs Fasegha.
“The questions I missed were not in my questions, ma.”
She took it from me and looked through it.
“Ehn?” she asked, a shapely eyebrow raised.
I repeated myself, a little bit louder, as though she were hard of hearing and I was only partly reluctant to speak to her as though she were.
“This thing is complete,” she informed me, lifting it between her thumb and index finger.
“But...”
“But what?”
“It’s not.”
I watched her press her lips together. I watched her back straighten. I watched her pick out another booklet from the Anyakoha on her desk and hand it to me and even before I looked at it and compared it to mine, I knew. I knew Omar had pranked me.
“I am sorry, ma,” I said, handing her back the papers, after making a show of perusing them.
“You are a very silly girl. You think I have nothing to do with my time??? You come in here with all this foolishness?” Her fingers waved around in my direction, clarifying what she meant by foolishness.
I apologised again, and she took it as permission to clap her hands together dramatically and raise her voice. She talked, talked, got up and pointed a thin, ashy finger in my face. Some other teachers looked up from their work and kissed their tongues. I stood there with nothing to do but take it until she grew tired of berating me.
“Get out.”
I did and there was Omar and one of his classmates right outside, their grins wide and their eyes wet from laughter. Their ears had evidently been pressed to the door. I walked briskly past them, incensed.
“Ife? Wait nau.”
I refused to look back, taking long strides across the grass, while he jogged after me. I could hear him catching up. I felt his breath on my neck, warm and wet, before he took my hand and turned me around to face him.
“It was a joke,” he said, tucking two of my plaits behind my ear, his fingers gentle, his dark brown eyes apologetic.
Righttttt. As if Omar Danjuma would chase after me. He did not and he did not touch my hair and he did not apologise. But it was not as if I had expected him to, daydream aside.

*

I had not seen Omar in four years when he walked into my home, his jeans dark fromwith the falling rain, his hands cold when he took my own. I handed him a towel and he said, “Thank you. I wonder when rain in this country started falling in December.”
We were standing by the glass side of the wall, watching the rain thunder down on the black and greys of the outside world. It was a silly, impractical thing to do, living in a glass house. Somebody would throw a heavy rock and he and his friends would rob us so easily that we would deserve it, but Mummy had insisted on this one glass wall so there it was, with an iron protector behind it, which was swung open now, gripped by the hand of the boy I had grown up loving.
“How have you been, Ife gold?”
I laughed humorlessly.
“No, Ife. It’s been a long time. What have you been up to?”
I was attending the University of Ilorin and studying Chemistry. I remembered my last year of secondary school, lying on my bed, in long socks, chewing the brand of strawberry gum I was obsessed with then, my JAMB form in one hand. I had looked at the textbooks on my shelf, one by one, chanting, “Gbo gben ta. Gbo gben ye. Gbo gben tamulele atatamufe…”
My count song had landed on New Age Chemistry. I remembered that book even now. Pretty, slim, pink, the pages fragrant, full of pictures and useless if you were really interested in passing your exams. Nevertheless, my count song landed and I raised my form and scribbled Chemistry in the space for what I wanted to do with my life. It was not a totally random decision, of course. I do not hate Chemistry and it is a perfectly sensible thing to study. Besides, Rara had taught me that song and Rara was good luck.
“Chemistry,” I told Omar.
He smiled, his eyes warm and sad.
“I know that. Your brother told me. What have you been up to apart from Chemistry?”
I looked away, wrapping my arms around myself.
“You are asking me about Timehin. If you want to ask about Timehin, ask about Timehin.”
He said nothing. The rain filled the silence. I scoffed and then he was crying as he stood in my living room. It was not the way I would have imagined Omar cried. I did not think it would be this quiet, soundless paroxysm. I did not expect this flavour of pain and I did not expect it to scare me as much as it did.

*

My brother sat in his usual supper spot, a shadowed alcove in the secondary school refectory, surrounded by loud senior students, comfortable in their culture of noise and superiority, smug in the rapport they had spent the last five years building amongst themselves. Timehin was beautiful, his skin flawless and light brown, his eyes large, and framed with long, dark lashes. He took after our mother in this and in the way teachers were hesitant to punish him when he deserved it, in the way other students were eager to say, “How’s it nau?” and invite him to all their illegal parties when he walked by them in school halls, bouncing on his toes, flashing the silver of his smile. He lacked Omar’s reticence, was open and sincerely friendly, his beautiful eyes fixed on whoever he was speaking to, kind and interested.
“Ife,” Amaka said when I sat down opposite her and Omar. My brother’s girlfriend flipped through a History textbook which rested on the knees of her crossed legs, one skinny wrist balanced underneath her pointed chin. Delicate, he had said, looking amused and happy, when I first told him about her skinny wrists. I had picked the wrists because there was nothing else about her I felt I could criticise. She was stunning, maybe more than Timehin himself.
Omar arrived while I was speaking to Timehin and slumped into a closeby seat, his face appearing severe in the near-darkness. He stayed silent until he had heard enough to realise I was telling on him and then he scoffed.
“It was a joke,” he said to me evenly, an edge of irritation in his voice.
“And so?”
“And so, you are five years old? That’s why you can’t take a simple joke?”
“Mrs Fasegha yelled at me.”
“She yells at everybody.”
I looked at Timehin.
“Your brother is not going to beat me up,” Omar pointed out.
Timehin laughed. “I am not going to beat him up, Ife.”
“I want an apology,” I demanded. Amaka smiled at me sadly, for a brief moment, before turning back to her book and there was something sharply pitiful about the way she did it. In the curl of her lips, I saw a lot of things she knew about me and a lot of things which she had assumed.

*

“You remember Amaka?” I asked Omar then. He did. More than that, he knew where she went to school and what for. They had been classmates for six years, I had forgotten. Friends even. Amaka had dated Timehin for a long time, until midway through his second year at university.
“After Amaka, Timehin went out with Becca.”
 Omar knew of Becca. He had never met her of course, but he was one of my brother’s best friends, so even living and schooling in the North, in the four years they had been mostly apart, Omar would know of the girls my brother saw.
“She was very different from Amaka. Tall, lanky, wore shapeless jeans.”
He smiled, lifting one side of his mouth, almost in the way I remembered.
“She was SUG,” I told him, expecting my face or voice to darken. They did not. “She was the kind of SUG that actually cared, Omar.”
He looked at me. He knew this already, I am sure.
“She and her friends used to paint placards and get students to march the university premises.” I raised both hands, and played at holding a placard. I marched around Omar, stomping my feet and squeezing my face.
“BETTER SALARIES!”
“NO MORE STRIKES!” He joined in.
“ADEWALE IS A GOD-FORSAKEN THIEF!” We laughed, lightly and barely.
That was Becca, the girl my brother dated after. Always demanding something, but I am not criticising this. There was a lot to demand; there was a lot that needed to be done better but I was not going to be the one to go into the streets screaming for it, and I did not understand the species of person that would.
“She convinced me to join a march once and I did,” I said.
“How was that?”
I remembered myself that day, in my favourite sunglasses, my voice raised, enthusiastically hitting passing students with my large, bright green palm frond. Join the fight, comrades.
“I don’t know…I did not really get it. I do not think I ever will,” I told Omar.
“Timehin got it, I think. Becca changed him.”
He did. He went on every march with her, and on some without her, standing in front of the crowd, his hands stretched out, his eyes unfamiliar in many ways, but not really. Becca had not changed him.
“Timehin was always like that,” I said. “Always full of that immense energy. He simply found, in the work his ugly girlfriend did, something he too wanted to do. My brother was becoming the person he was going to be.”
Omar was no longer looking at me. He was looking out into the slowing rain, the drenched outdoor tiles and dripping trees in our compound.
“He should have kept his protests within school.”
He should have. Even Becca did. But what of it? There were so many things my brother should have done. He should have broken up with Amaka sooner, because he fell out of love long before the relationship ended. He should have gone anywhere else that day, anywhere that was not the Mainland Bridge protest. He should have studied for that Integrated Science test when he was eleven. He should have backed down when a policeman raised his gun and pointed it in his face. He should not have continued screaming, his fist pounding, punctuating the air, “We will be free! No more! We will be free!” into the face of a lawless man, his hand on a trigger he could do anything with and he knew he could do anything with. Because who cares? Because who is free as a result? Who is grieving? Because I need to be told what exactly was worth his life. Because he should have thought about Mummy.  Because Timehin should have thought about me. Because it is raining in December, and the fingers of his friend are in my hair.

 *

“You are not in trouble, abi, Ife?” Timehin asks, flanked by Amaka and Omar, and I can see how he is, at this moment, not on my side. I shake my head, angry and hurt, and he promptly goes back to his food and his girlfriend.
 I am seven and dancing in our backyard even though Mummy has told me and Timehin not to. She has to go to work and does not trust the neighbours. “Stay inside until I, and only I, get back.” I dig my fingers into the sand underneath my feet and scatter the grains, upwards, shaking my arms, shaking my wrists and ankles, as it comes cascading back downwards.
He looks at me. He grins. He mouths, “Ife gold.”

        She can’t get up. Morning light maps the cities of her room: takeout cartons, trash bags, rotting houseplants. The buzz of an insect; I wish I could be as big as a fly. Etcetera. There is nothing more oppressive than the first reaches of spilled sun (which leaks from her blackout curtains that she can’t quite get to blackout the room), the first chirp of a spring thrush. Once she ran out in her pajamas with a BB gun and shot it every which direction, in a 5AM daze, as if not only trying to take out the birds, but the sky too, the sun. She could never sleep much when she was a kid; nNow she can’t sleep enough. It’s something different to be that close to objectness, to be wrapped in cotton all baby-like and just lie there so inert, so still, like a rock—it’s something funny, that. It’s her personal theory that everybody strives towards something like stillness in their lives. In-its-place-ness. That quality which can usually only be redeemed through death. She figured that’s why people drink, fuck, shoot up, play softball on the weekends, make art. That there’s something like fire in all of us that needs to be settled, shaped. Jeans on, left leg first. Then socks. She was late for work. She will get fully dressed, eat breakfast even, all while coursing with an adrenaline released by the condition of lateness which hangs over her like a peripheral billboard, then arrive at work, get chewed out by her supervisor, take some phone calls, print out whatever needs to be printed; then thirty minute break, then de-facto break in the bathroom, then more phone calls, then home. Then sleep. The only thing that could break her from this constant daze of prepositional framing deprived of time (the forever and cyclical going to, from, in scenes, places), was the rent due notice slipped under her door, the words THIS AMOUNT MUST BE PAID IMMEDIATELY bolded and visible even from where she stood in the bathroom across the hall, brushing her teeth. She might quit today. She had a place ready for her down state in Duanesburg, two bedrooms, a bathroom, a roommate. It'd be better down there. Easier. Less birds—or at the very least, windows which closed all the way. After some futile attempts at shaping her hair, she shoulders on a faux-suede jacket and rushes out the door before doubling back: there was a letter on top of the rent due notice. She opens it. Sender: WTD. No return address. Inside seemed to be some sort of ad, or a myriad of disconnected ads, all on the same page like the back end of a tabloid. She puts it in the waste bin, making a mental note to tell her landlord to stop slipping his weird junk mail under her door.
She never felt like she got it right. This kind of inhabiting that they demanded from her. That sprightly, assistant-ness which her job required. A straight back. A clean voice. A lexicon filled with “sir” and “I’m afraid I can’t…” and “hold please?” There’s a ring. Her hand snaps to the phone a hello-you’ve-reached-Martin-and-Martin-what-legal-mishap-can-we-fix-for-you-today hanging on her lower lip, like a tiger waiting to be uncaged in a gladiatorial bout. She averaged 1.112 rings before picking up, something which despite herself she was quite proud of. There’s labored breathing on the other side. She waits, half expecting a demand for ransom.
“Ermm… Hello? Sir?”
“Oh oh yes… Ahem. Sorry.”
“…you’ve reached Martin and Martin… What can we help you with today?”
“Welkins, the detective wants to see attorney… Martin? James Martin. About the Bus Case?
She froze. Welkins the detective. WTD…WTD. It tangled in her head with a peculiar resonance as she thought it. What strangeness. She catches a glimpse of herself in the windowpane—her mouth agape and a look of near-horror, as if she’d just caught her nephew jamming a fork into an electrical socket—and adjusts herself, watching as her image ruffles its hair, pats down its blouse. Mirrors are funny; eschewing any Lacanian psychoanalysis, just to see herself—Jules—condensed into two dimensions, squished—made object—was uncomfortable, inhuman; a psychic confrontation with everything at stake. You have to be brave to look in the mirror.
“Hello?”
“Oh! My apologies. I’ll see about getting you an appointment with Mr. Martin—he’s very busy this weekend.”
The man on the other side grumbles something about how they’d already be talking to the attorney if it was the eighties and settles on next Thursday at three. The bus case was a curious one. She’d heard about it in snippets, on the local news in the other room while she sat down to eat microwave-ready ravioli and skim nihilistic blogs on the conditions of sweatshop-working children over in Vietnam, the by now near-inevitable event of melted ice caps and tsunamis every other weekend in maybe a decade or so, the myth of freedom in a post-industrial America, and even the odd gore video or two (on more than one occasion her scrolling habits led her to some snuff film of a brutal hitjob in Brazil or  CCTV footage of a shooting at a gas station); it was both for her to lament and to satisfy a prenatal urge, this need to be closer to a quality of doomed-ness, to orbit this feeling of horror or fear, this brute reality, which she felt somehow was robbed from her. She was a vehicle for the suffering of others. For things like the Bus Case, which began with questionable events at a nightclub, involving more drugs than obtainable by Scarface himself, a sizeable helping of child endangerment, strange cult-like dancing (one witness described the phenomenon as a ‘trance’), and which ultimately culminated in a botched double suicide in the back of a bus. She calls Mr. Martin. He was representing the one living defendant in the case.
“Hey it’s Jules. Just wanted to let you know that you got an appointment coming up next week with detective Welkins. He wants to talk about the Bus Case.”
“Oh, of course he does. Probably will talk my ear off about the statement Manuel made to the news. Tell him to piss right the hell off.”
“Erhmm… sir, the problem is I have you scheduled with him next Thursday, like I said.”
Sharp exhale.
“Christ-on-a-fucking-stake Jules stop making decisions without telling me first.”
“…sorry. I just figured, since he’s with the police an’ all…”
“Well there’s your problem—all this figuring you do, what… tell me, what’s one good thing that’s come outta your figuring?!”
“… Also. What’s this about Manuel’s statement?”
“That sad sonofabitch told them something crazy like ‘it was all WDT’s fault,’ or ‘TWD made him do it,’ or something like that. S’ just complicating things.”
She pauses.
“Huh. Well, it was nice talking to you sir—I have to get going. Sorry.”
She hangs up. She asks her coworker to cover her shift, says her cat died, or is dying, or is about to be dying. He says he can’t. Too bad. She packs her things neatly into her purse and walks out the firm’s revolving doors. Back straight. Eyes forward. The march of the doomed.

                                         / / / / / / / / / /

        	She fished out the letter from her wastebin. All her blinds and curtains are shut. Are They following me? No. She checks her peephole as she hears footsteps outside her door. Just another resident. A dog barks from the floor above. There’s a no-pet policy here at Evergreen Housing. All she has left to eat for dinner is a can of Campbell's A-Z tomato soup. But she’s afraid. What if WTD’s right there, spelled out in my soup—then I really lost, then I really can’t escape. They would’ve won. So no alphabet soup for me, sir, no thank you. She searches up Manuel’s media statement. The letter is still unopened on her desk, isolated from the rubbish. Manuel’s puffy face comes up on her screen, the hulking man dead-eyed and nauseous-looking. He says when push came to shove, he didn’t do it. He couldn’t. That he left his buddy Sam to die alone. That WTD was behind it all—those scheming bastards. Or rather, had WTD not existed, they never would’ve been there, no, they probably would’ve been smoking on the couch, watching 30 Rock, or playing pool over at Rodney’s, eyeing broads they had no intention of talking to. She tapes her laptop’s webcam. Opens the letter and looks over the contents, carefully this time. Ads surrounding a symbol in the center; they appeared to be sponsors, which included Baxby’s, a global ice cream chain (recently under fire for allegations of mixing raw pig’s blood into their strawberry flavor), Hercules, a regional gym (known to locals as THE spot for acquiring schedule I drugs, rumor being there’s a man who sells in the last shower to the left), and Nike, among others. The symbol in the center is vaguely phallic, kind of resembling a plunger with an arrow through the handle. On the back—which she’d never noticed—was an address, and then the words:
                                                        	WE WANT YOU !!!
Paired with an image of a smiling golden retriever in a birthday hat. She cuts out the address and slips it in her purse. Lays down on her couch and stares at the ceiling, wondering just how something can find itself so structured, so at peace with the world—so still.

                                         / / / / / / / / /

        	Her boots hit the pavement like a jackhammer. She’d seen the plunger symbol three times since then—since she’d left—on walls as graffiti or painted into the street, meshing with the road signs. Even now, as she looks at the maze of interconnected industry before her, the weaving lines of roads, the oblique slant of apartment complexes and office buildings, the subtle curvature of the horizon, she can, in every which direction, trace out with her finger, Their symbol. Even her own being can’t escape it! It is in my hair, the corneas of my eyes, mapped out in my wrinkles, shaped—given life—by my fingers! She runs faster. Across the street from her is an old woman who smiles at her and waves. She runs the opposite direction. The moon looks fake. She turns a corner, stops to catch her breath. A man wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the symbol. The logo. She ducks. They wouldn’t let her leave the place when she visited the address. They said once you’re in you’re in and that’s that. The address had led to what seemed to be a hot yoga meeting in-progress, a gathering of shaggy, anxious teens and war veterans and ex-AA members; all of whom wore the same deadpan expression, as if robbed of living, an uncanny mannequin-like stillness to their faces. The meeting was led by a strange man called Gabriel, who had the whole group stretching after him in Simon-says fashion. She played along at first. But she soon began to panic. The bureaucratic flourishes, the way Gabriel pronounced his e’s (drawled out, elongated), the catering, which always seemed to have an excess of those marinated mozzarella balls and tomato toothpick things which Jules despised (a waste of good cheese, in her opinion), and most egregious, the subtle glances, which were almost like suppressive fire against her psyche, erupting from every odd direction, friendly faces, strangers, critters, rats; regardless she was the target. Everything was aligned against her. At the end they passed around a grenade shaped flask, which everyone took a sip of. She did too. She didn’t know why. It tasted something like rubbing alcohol and peanut oil. She stopped running; they were all gone. The moon seems to move across the sky—she can see it.

                                         / / / / / / / / / /

“We offer undying death. Death which does not require one to leave this earth… death which does not inspire tragedy. Death which leaves no ripples in its wake…I’m talking about erasure of YOU, consciousness, but with enough still intact to perform just as you did before. Think about it as letting somebody else take the helm, while you take a well deserved break from this… thing you’ve endured.”
Nobody seems surprised. This is just the type of paranoid manifesto they’d expected to hear upon coming here.
“Behold!!”
Gabriel turns up the theatrics as soon as the object of attention is introduced. It’s a man. Black joggers, red flannel, hipster beard, a look of utter confusion mixed with glum resignation on his face.
“This is Alex. We’ve been working on him for a while: he’s what helped us perfect the flask mix y’all have so kindly been drinking.”
He kind of makes Alex do a half-twirl, like he’s a model, leading him by the arm.
“Well, it’d be a bit disingenuous to say this is actually Alex. Alex as we knew him is dead, deep and dormant buried somewhere within this fleshy husk who is his replacement. Nobody but us know this. He still acts and behaves just as he did before—the caveat being there is nothing behind those actions. We induce a mental erasure which leaves behind nothing but the physical you, which nobody will be able to distinguish from you prior. So—basically, guilt-free, 100% ethical euthanasia. With this program you can rest without having to worry about who will take care of your diabetic mother, or your half-dead St. Bernard. No, they will be taken care of, and they won’t grieve your death, because to them, you’ll be right there in front of them, in all your porous glory, able-bodied enough to hug, kiss, fuck, work.”
Alex is looking straight at the center of the crowd, eyes belying no traces of autonomy. The crowd is very obviously skeptical, with scoffs erupting sporadically amongst the members; despite this, nobody is vocal about their discontent.
“It’s a yearlong program. The only thing you have to do: sip from the flask once daily at our meetings. It’s important that it’s a communal thing, it only works when we do it every day, together. Then, slowly, the solution will erode your entire personhood from the inside. Dull your consciousness to the point of comatose. But again, this is undetectable from the outside.”
Less people are leaving than Manuel expected. Someone in front of him shouts out what’s the catch.
“There is none. Whole year is free to everyone here. The only thing is we’re rather strict with our membership. There’s rankings and tasks and all that, but they don’t really mean anything.”
Gabriel flashes a commercial smile.

        	She’s staring at the ceiling again. There’s a spider up there, wrapping the fly in its web. The room bares itself, swallows her in its nakedness, the walls warped and winding inwards, the empty floor which seems to contain her world. She looked in the mirror yesterday and saw a woman stare back.

“Astrid? Dude, she’s totally knocked out. Astrid. Astrid!”
 I clamped my hands over my ears to try and block out my sister’s voice. I was hoping that if I wished hard enough, I would wake up from this horrible dream and find myself back in my room, safe and sound. My brother and sister wouldn’t have pushed me to lie to our mother about where we were going, and we wouldn’t be hurtling down the highway above the speed limit to commit felony trespassing in order to get content for my brother’s Instagram page.
“She just doesn’t wanna talk to you, Ava. She’s faking it.” My brother’s voice was muffled by the hum of the car’s engine. I curled further into myself. If the two of them wanted to act like this was a good idea, by all means, they could. But I refused to entertain it.
“Astrid, come on.” My sister reached back from her seat in the car and pushed at my shoulder. “You agreed to this. Don’t make it worse for the rest of us because you want to back out.”
The desire to defend myself overtook the importance of maintaining my vow of silence. I sat up and fixed my siblings with an icy glare.“You guys basically tricked me into lying to Mom. If someone catches us trespassing, it’ll go on our records- especially if you post about it, Austin. What if colleges see that? Or if I want to be a politician?”
Ava snorted and looked back at me incredulously before glancing at Austin, who I could see was fighting not to laugh. “A politician,” Ava snickered. “Sure, Astrid.” The two of them grinned at one another. My objection died on my tongue. I closed my eyes and let my head fall against the car seat. Austin, Ava, and I were triplets born two minutes apart. But I had never felt like we were a trio. It was more like the two of them were twins and I was their dopey sidekick. Ava and Austin were the same person in different fonts, both sporting perfect black hair that never seemed to have a bad day, golden skin which always tanned but never burned, and natural athletes who excelled at whatever they tried their hand at. Ava and Austin ran our high school together as captains of the women’s and men’s soccer teams, surrounded by more friends than I could ever hope to count and as every teacher’s favorite students.
Even though I was born first, my entire existence was defined by my being “Austin and Ava’s little sister.” If you looked closely, you could tell I was related to them- our hair and eyes were the same, and our faces shared similar features. But the resemblances stopped there. I was paler than the two of them by miles, wore glasses, was unathletic, and routinely had to ask our Mom to order for me at restaurants because I couldn’t muster up the courage. I didn’t fit into their little world. I only ever interacted with the two of them in the mornings before school, at dinner, and whenever our Mom dragged me to one of their many, many soccer games. But Friday night, when I was sitting alone in my room, Austin and Ava came home from their soccer practices earlier than usual, bringing me takeout from my favorite restaurant. They invited me to hang out with them and let me pick the movie we watched, not getting mad when I hogged the popcorn.
Then, casually, Ava asked if I wanted to go on an overnight camping trip, just the three of us. Austin backed her up, saying that getting “quality sibling time” would be fun. I felt like I could see the light at the end of a tunnel. Could this be the beginning of them bringing me along? The end of my sitting on the sidelines? Their only request was that I be the one to get our Mom’s permission because, according to them, she’d only say yes if I was the one who asked. I was quick to oblige. Our Mom was ecstatic to hear that Ava and Austin had finally decided to include me in their activities, agreeing wholeheartedly to our trip. The next day, an hour into our drive, they broke the news- we would actually be spending twenty-four hours in an abandoned orphanage, taking videos and pictures for my brother’s “Urban Explorer” Instagram group.
I was horrified. I immediately pulled out my phone to call my Mom and sell the two of them out, but Ava lunged backward and wrestled my phone out of my hand, shoving it into her pocket until I could “prove that I’d chilled out .” I shouted and pummeled the back of Austin’s seat with the soles of my cConverse, yelling until my voice was hoarse. But he insisted that it would be fun and that I needed to get out of the house anyway. I begged them to turn around until I was on the brink of tears, but the two of them continued to ignore me. After a few more minutes I gave up my efforts and laid face down in the backseat, hoping that we’d get pulled over for speeding so I could tell a police officer I’d been kidnapped.
“Cheer up, Astrid.” Ava reached back to pat my arm sympathetically, snatching her hand away when I tried to hit her. “We’re barely trespassing. You’re always talking about how much you love learning about our family’s history- great-uncle Jesse died at the orphanage, remember? It’s our birthright to go check it out.”
“Oh, like you have such a connection to an uncle who died when Truman was president,” I snapped back. “Grandma said she doesn’t even remember him. When great-grandpa and great-grandma died, she was a baby. The two of them were sent to different places. Who cares?”
I saw Austin glance up at me through the rearview mirror and raise an eyebrow. “Are you seriously telling me you’re not at all curious about what’s in there? My explorer group says that there’s a hundred unmarked graves on the property, all kids that they used as lab rats.” He turned to face me fully. “Plus, we’ll be the first in the group to visit it. It’s untouched. You’re telling me you’re not curious about what’s been left behind?”
I slumped down in my seat. It was true that I was intrigued. Ava hadn’t been wrong when she said that I loved learning about our family’s history, and the only thing I knew about great-uncle Jesse was that he died at sixteen while in the orphanage. I was also a rabid fan of the TV show Ghost Hunters, and I found myself drawn to the idea of exploring a property that could potentially be filled with spirits. “I’m not happy about this,” I announced as I turned to stare out the window. “I still think it’s dangerous.”
Ava laughed. “You think everything’s dangerous.”

*

The sun had just started to dip in the sky when we reached the orphanage’s grounds. While Ava and Austin unloaded the car, I leaned against the door and checked my watch. It was just after five o’clock. I turned my attention to the forest ahead of us, shifting from foot to foot as an uneasy feeling upset my stomach. Austin had told me that the orphanage itself lay at the end of a two-mile trek through the forest, and the idea of being that far from our only way home was making me sick.
Ava knocked me out of my thoughts by tossing a backpack in my direction as she walked toward me. “Let’s get moving!” She slapped me hard on the shoulder, grinning when I scowled at her. “I don’t want to be here when the nighttime monsters get active.” I glared at her as I white-knuckled my backpack. Ava laughed at my expression and threw her arm around me, holding me close and forcing me to start walking towards the forest path. “I’m kidding! Totally kidding, Astrid, I promise.”

*

The walk took close to an hour. I was huffing and puffing by its end, head hanging low as we clambered over massive rocks and overgrown roots. Ava and Austin chatted while they hiked, acting as if they were on a nice walk through the park rather than climbing what to me felt like Mt. Everest. Austin was the one who announced our arrival when he suddenly stopped walking, barely budging when I ran directly into his back. “We’re here!”
I grimaced and adjusted my skewed glasses as I peered around my brother. The orphanage was constructed of brick and stone, stretched three stories tall, and was adorned with a steeple and bell tower. Moss covered the building from head to toe, and it was outfitted with stained glass windows. Even though I felt like I could faint at any moment from a combination of exhaustion and fear, I found myself almost enchanted by the building’s exterior. I glanced at my brother. “You said they experimented on kids here?”
Austin nodded, making his way towards the chains which rested on the rusted black gate. “Yup. They sent a ton of impoverished orphans here right after World War Two - I guess they figured they might as well get their money’s worth by using them as test subjects. They were trying to cure diseases. Polio, alcoholism, getting rid of the ‘“criminal’” gene in vagrants, stuff like that.” He shrugged his backpack off and pulled out a pair of bolt cutters as he looked over his shoulder. “Ava, start the video.”
Ava pulled out her phone and gave him a thumbs up. Austin took a deep breath and then grinned at the camera. “Hour one of our twenty-four hour sleepover challenge is a go!” He whooped, jumping forward and clamping the chains in the jaws of the bolt cutters, snapping them in half like twigs. Austin dramatically kicked the gate open with a loud clang, striding into the courtyard with Ava in his wake. I sighed and followed them in, trekking across the overgrown lawn to get to the large wooden front doors.
The doors to the orphanage were stiff and unyielding, requiring both Austin and Ava to use all of their strength to get them to budge. When the doors finally creaked open the three of us were hit with a tidal wave of dust, accompanied by an overwhelming smell of mildew and decay. My chest ached as I began to cough- the combination of exertion and intense dust was making it difficult to catch my breath. “I told you she would have an asthma attack,” Ava said as she sauntered into the building. Austin rolled his eyes as he entered after her, pulling my inhaler out of his backpack and handing it to me as he walked past.
After I managed to reign in my coughing and wipe my eyes, I followed my siblings through the doors and took a good look around the building’s interior. The main room we entered into had a wooden floor and an expansive spiral staircase leading upwards to a landing with a wooden archway. A glass chandelier with candle holders hung from the ceiling, parallel to a beautiful pane of stained glass. Aside from the fact that it was dusty beyond belief and had somewhat decayed from years of neglect, it indeed was a gorgeous building.
 	Ava and Austin didn’t bother themselves with taking in the interior and ran ahead immediately, sprinting up the staircase. Not wanting to be left alone, I rushed after them, tripping up the stairs as my backpack slowed me down. “This is so cool!” Ava shouted as she raced down the hallway, sliding to a halt in front of a door and flinging it open. “Check out this bedroom!” She and Austin barely glanced inside it before they were off again, sprinting through the corridors, whooping and cheering. I had entirely run out of breath in my attempt to keep up and half-collapsed against the door frame of the room Ava had found, sucking in lungfuls of air to try and get rid of the black spots permeating my vision.
Once I had regained my composure, I peered inside the opened door. There were six total beds inside- three sets of bunk beds. They were all neatly made up, military-style, undisturbed after all these years. I wandered further inside the room, running my hand absentmindedly across a dresser as my eyes explored. As my hand came to the end of the wood, I paused, feeling my fingers glide across unexpected grooves. I looked down. Something was scratched into the surface. I squinted at it, leaning down until my nose was almost touching the wood.
“It’s... In.. The… Desk….” I said the words slowly. “Astrid.” I finished reading, and my blood froze in my veins. My heart rate shot into the stratosphere. Did I just read my own name? Was I hallucinating? There was no way. The orphanage had been shut down in 1950- who in 1950 was named Astrid? With shaking hands, I found the message again with my fingers, reading it out loud once more. My name was inscribed into the wood. What was this? Were Ava and Austin playing a prank on me?
“Boo!” Ava grabbed my shoulders and I screamed, flinging myself sideways and slamming into a nearby bedpost. I started hyperventilating, shaking so badly that my glasses nearly fell off my face, and babbling incoherently as I scrambled backward. Ava threw her hands up. “Woah, shit! I didn’t mean to scare you that badly.” I made a keening noise in my throat, motioning wildly at the dresser. Ava frowned and walked to where I was pointing. I watched her find the message, her eyes darting across the wood. Her body tensed as she finished reading. She turned to the door, her tone uneasy. “Austin, can you come here?”
Austin bounded into the room, his smile waning as he looked at Ava and I’s faces. “What’s up?” We both pointed to the dresser. Austin walked over and ran his hand along the top, silently mouthing the words as he read them. He finished and turned to Ava, grinning. “Oh, that’s awesome. When did you have time to do that?”
Ava looked uncomfortably over her shoulder to where I was standing. “I didn’t. I thought you did.” Austin’s smile disappeared as he followed Ava’s eyes over to me. There was a pregnant pause as the two of them exchanged glances. The silence hung in the air like an oppressive cloud until Ava’s uncomfortable and unsettled laughter cut through it.
“Okay, we got you!” Ava’s laugh was a little too loud, a little too forced, and her eyes were a little too wide when as she glanced over at Austin. Austin quickly caught on, a fake-looking smile appearing on his face as he joined Ava in nodding and laughing.
“We totally did!” He agreed, nudging Ava with his shoulder. “That’s going in the vlog.” I forced myself to laugh with them, the noise sounding intensely unnatural as it yanked itself from my chest. Austin’s eyes betrayed his plastered smile as he reached out and hooked his arm into mine, pulling me towards the door. “C’mon, let’s keep exploring.”

*

By the time nine o’clock rolled around the building had been filled with inky black darkness, turning previously unsettling corridors into downright terrifying nothingness. I begged my siblings to call it a day and find a place to rest. The two of them seemed to feel at least a bit of sympathy for me because instead of brushing me off and continuing to investigate, they agreed to settle down for the night. We explored until we found a large gymnasium that seemed safe enough to sleep in, setting up lanterns and unrolling our sleeping bags. We ate a quiet dinner of canned beans and just-add-water MREsS that Austin had brought while we sipped on juice and made small talk. None of us wanted to give voice to what we’d seen earlier in the day. By the time ten-thirty rolled around, I had changed into a pair of pajamas and nestled into my sleeping bag, eyes closed as I tried to relax enough to drift off. Austin and Ava were quiet for a time, the only noises in the room consisting of the hum of the lantern and our combined breathing. But Ava broke the silence with a whisper. “Austin. No bullshit, did you write that?” I held my breath, hoping he would admit to being behind it and confirm that it had all been a prank. My heart sank to the floor when I heard him murmur quietly, “No.”

*

Sleep was an ever-elusive beast. Every time I felt myself drifting off I remembered the message scratched into the wood and jerked awake, my heart beating loudly in my ears. After my third time reawakening, I gave up on sleep, opting instead to stare at the gymnasium’s ceiling and listen to the steady breathing of my siblings to pass the time. My watch dutifully beeped as the clock hit twelve AM. I sighed. This time tomorrow, I’ll be at home, I thought, rolling onto my side and closing my eyes. But just as I started to get comfortable a wave of nausea rolled over me. I gagged as my stomach roiled, threatening to expel everything I’d eaten that day. I sat up and unzipped myself from my sleeping bag, intending to find an empty room to puke in. I knew my siblings would never let me live it down if I threw up all over their things. But as soon as I got to my feet, I immediately doubled over. Cramps wracked my body, and I fell to one knee as the room began to slowly spin and blur around me. I gritted my teeth, digging my nails into the floor as I fought the urge to dry-heave. This didn’t feel like it was being caused by something I’d eaten.
“Austin,” I croaked. “Ava.” I heard them mutter responses, and through my blurred vision I could see Ava holding her head in her hands while Austin tossed and turned in his sleeping bag. I tried to crawl over to them, but I couldn’t move. I felt like I was made of lead. I slumped down on the cool floor and curled over myself, groaning- my stomach was cramping and spasming, the air felt thin, my chest was constricting, my lungs refused to inflate, I felt like I was sinking through the floor, the room was spinning, and I couldn’t see where my glasses were and the room was spinning and spinning and spinning and-
WHAM.
I was sitting in a chair. My hands were gripping the armrests. It was hot- hotter than it had been before. I cracked an eye open. I was in an office. A fan was blowing in the window, and I could hear laughter and yelling floating in from the outside. The room was immaculately clean, not a speck of dust in sight. I touched my face. I wasn’t wearing glasses. I looked down at my legs. I was wearing a skirt. Ugly, plaid. Long socks. My shoes, black and shiny, looked like they belonged on an American girl doll. I looked to my left. There was a calendar. “June 19th, 1949” was the date circled. I was sure now that I was in an extremely lucid dream. I looked to my right. Ava was sitting next to me in a chair, eyes wide as she stared at her own legs, wearing the same plaid skirt and cardigan I had on. She made similar motions as I had when I’d opened my eyes, looking down at herself, running her hands over her clothing, and then slowly turning to me. She swallowed hard, her voice soft. “What the fuck?” I nodded in silent solidarity.
The door opening behind us made both of us jump. A woman strode in and walked around us, her red blouse and tightly permed curls reminiscent of what our great-grandmother wore in black-and-white photos shown at family reunions. She held a manila folder that she tossed onto the desk as she sat down behind it. The woman lit a cigarette and blew a plume of smoke out of her mouth as she fixed Ava and I with a disinterested look. She opened the folder and briefly scanned its contents before looking back at us. “You two are sisters, correct?”
We nodded.
“And you two are orphans?”
Ava and I looked at each other, unsure of how to answer. The woman rolled her eyes. “Orphans it is, then. And your names? They aren’t listed on the intake form.”
Ava whispered, “Ava.” She looked at me. “And that’s Astrid.”
The woman jotted something down. “And who was responsible for leaving you here today?”
Again, silence from the both of us as we stared blankly at her from across the desk.
The woman rolled her eyes. “Alright.” She wrote something in the folder and shut it, putting it inside her desk. “Your brother is finishing up his intake process as well. He’ll be in the gym shortly.” She took another drag of her cigarette, blowing it in our direction. “I’m happy to officially welcome you both to Helping Hand’s Home for Children and Young Adults. You two will love it here.”
Ava and I were ushered out of the woman’s office and into the hallway. The previously empty corridors were filled with people, ranging from toddlers to teenagers our age, all wearing identical uniforms. I reached out for Ava’s hand. She took it, squeezing it softly. The two of us shuffled through the swathes of people in the corridors, walking in a silent daze. We found the gym quickly enough- after all, it had only been a few hours ago that we had set our things down in there to get ready for bed. I pushed the doors open, and the gym, which had been entirely empty only moments ago save for my siblings and me, was packed to the brim with residents. I scanned the room, looking for Austin, but I didn’t see him. I started to panic. I turned to Ava, ready to ask her where we should look next when a familiar voice called out to us both.
“Guys!” I whirled around to see Austin racing down the hallway towards us, outfitted in long black slacks and a white button-up shirt, the same outfit as the rest of the boys we’d seen so far. His hair had been cut from its usual shag to a military-style comb-over, reminiscent of Elvis Presley. If I hadn’t been so freaked out, I would have made fun of him. “Guys. Oh my god.” He yanked Ava and me into a tight hug. Austin pulled away after a few moments, looking back and forth between us both. His voice was shaky. “Am I dreaming, or is this really happening?”

        "We found a secluded corner of the gymnasium to huddle in, sitting like peas in a pod. “So we’re in a 1950s orphanage,” I muttered, watching as a few kids our age played an intense game of dodgeball. “I quite literally can’t think of anything worse.”
Ava pinched the bridge of her nose with her fingers. “This is absolutely insane.” She gestured around at the gymnasium. “Like, what do we do? How do we get back? I do not want to live out the rest of my days in the fifties. Eighties, maybe, but not here.” The three of us fell silent, not a single one of us being able to come up with a plan of action.
 	Our collective brooding was interrupted by a warm voice. “You three got a second?” A lanky boy was standing near us with a friendly smile, arms crossed over his chest. He was wearing the same uniform as Austin save for a pair of dog tags hanging around his neck. He had a head of loose black curls, pearly white teeth, and his skin was a light brown color, matching his hazel eyes. He grinned at us. “Name’s Jesse. Heard you cats were new here, and the higher-ups sent me to get you sorted out. You folks mind coming with me?” The three of us exchanged wide-eyed looks. That’s precisely what this day needed, I thought. A run-in with our dead uncle. I nodded my head at him. Jesse clapped his hands. “Right on! Follow me.”
 	The three of us followed behind Jesse as he gave us a tour of the facility. We passed through classrooms, bathrooms, the cafeteria, and the courtyard. As we walked, I tried to keep an eye out for any signs of distress- after all, just over a year from now, the doors to this place would be shuttered, and those running it arrested- but I saw nothing of concern. All things considered, this orphanage appeared to be a relatively happy place.
Jesse concluded our tour in front of a bedroom. “Ava and Astrid, you two are in here.” He opened the door. Six beds, arranged into three sets of bunk beds. My eyes immediately snapped to the left side of the room. A dresser, the dresser, was right there, right where it had been before. Jesse patted Austin on the shoulder. “Austin, you’re with me and the other fellas. Let’s give the ladies some time to relax before dinner.” Austin winced and glanced at us but didn’t resist Jesse’s pull. We watched the two of them make their way down the hallway, through the archway leading to the spiral stairs, and out of sight.
Ava and I picked an unoccupied bunk bed to share. She took the top bunk, and I took the bottom. “Ava?” I whispered after a few moments of silence. “What are we gonna do?”
Ava dropped her arm off the side of her bunk, and I reached out, taking her hand. “I’m not sure,” sShe whispered back.

*

It took nearly six weeks for us to get back to the present. The three of us kept waiting for headaches and nausea to whisk us back to the 21st century, but the days continued to pass with no sign of them. We started getting used to the 1950s. Every day we woke up at 6AM on the dot, brushed our teeth with the other kids, recited the pledge of allegiance, and went to classes. I excelled in the classroom. We were being taught things that I had learned in eighth grade, but the academic validation I got from scoring 100s on every test I took was quite a rush. Unfortunately, my social skills from the present had followed me into the past. Most of my friendships were formed with staff members, and I spent all of my free time in the nurse’s office, gossiping with them and helping them with their work.
On the other hand, Ava and Austin became wildly popular among the other residents. Ava never went anywhere without a group of girls following her, her cool and sarcastic personality acting like a siren call to them. Austin and Jesse became an inseparable duo, the two of them sitting at the top of the social hierarchy within the orphanage. Jesse was quite popular amongst everyone in the building and seemed to be knowledgeable about everything that went on within it. But when I asked him if he’d seen anyone disappearing or heard about experiments done on the orphans, he just laughed. “Of course not!” He shook his head. “This is probably the best place on earth for kids like us to live. I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”
On the cusp of our sixth week at Helping Hand’s Home for Children and Young Adults, I was working in the nurses’ office, listening to the radio. I had grown to love Billie Holiday, and her voice made the time go by quickly as I cut strips of cloth into bandages. I was reaching for a new roll when a sudden wave of nausea came over me. I took a deep breath and shook my head, thinking it was something I had eaten that was upsetting my stomach. But when my head started to get warm and my stomach turned over on itself, it was a stark reminder of six weeks prior. My body began to feel leaden, and my ears began to ring, nausea causing me to double over and drop to the floor. I squeezed my eyes shut, gasping for air- and suddenly, I was lying on my back in the gymnasium where I’d spent so much time in the last few weeks.
As soon as I caught my breath, I checked my watch. 6:00AM, 05/15/2022. Only six hours had passed here. I listened to Ava and Austin shout and flail in their sleeping bags, dragging themselves out and panting as they recovered. We all looked around in disbelief. We were home. As soon as we could move we all sprang to our feet and grabbed our backpacks, sprinting one after the other out of the gymnasium. In the last month and a half, we’d become experts in navigating the corridors of the orphanage, and with that knowledge in mind, we were outside and nearly through the black iron gates within a minute. Ava and Austin ran through first, and I followed, my feet pounding against the dirt. I was right behind them, we were going home, we were-
I skidded to a halt, unable to stop fast enough and tripping over my shoes, landing hard on my side on the gymnasium’s wooden floor. Ava and Austin, out of breath, appeared next to me. Ava shook her head in disbelief as she spun in a circle, chest heaving as she looked wildly around the room. “No way.” Like rats in a maze, we ran again, trying to get through the black gates- but we ended up back in the gymnasium every time we tried. Ava flung her backpack to the ground after the sixth failed attempt, a frustrated scream tearing itself from her throat as she collapsed on the floor. “God DAMNIT!” She cradled her head in her hands. Austin sat down next to her and put his arm consolingly around Ava’s shoulders, hanging his head in defeat.
I was on my hands and knees, breathing hard. I closed my eyes. We couldn’t leave. Why? It wasn’t like we were spirits. We hadn’t died here. According to Ghost Hunters, ghosts only remained on land that their remains were still on, haunting the land if they weren’t appropriately buried.
My head snapped up. Jesse. One of a hundred kids buried in unmarked graves. My siblings and I weren’t spirits, but we were related to a boy who was. There was no way he wanted to be buried in an unmarked grave. I snapped my fingers to get Ava and Austin’s attention. “It’s Jesse. He’s the reason we can’t leave. He’s buried somewhere on the property, and he’s keeping us from going.”
Ava wiped her tears with the back of her hand. “So how do we find him?” She asked, her voice wobbling. “We don’t know where the graveyard is.”
I looked at my watch. “If my thinking is correct, In six hours, we’ll be back in the 1950s. All we have to do is find out where Jesse dies, find his bones, and bring him with us so we can bury him properly.” Ava and Austin stared at me like I had grown three heads. I tried to reassure them with a smile. “How hard could it be?”

*

By the time it was 12AM, we had all fallen asleep, exhausted from our escape attempts. We woke up back in our orphanage bunks, dressed in our 50s outfits like we’d never left. But the world had continued to tick while we’d been gone. When we had returned to the present, it had been September 2nd, 1954. But upon our return, it was February 5th, 1955, and things had taken a sharp turn for the worse.
New management had taken over Helping Hand’s Home for Children and Young Adults, a private pharmaceutical company named Johnson and James. Even though we had apparently been “present” during the entire five-months we’d been gone, Jesse was more than happy to rehash how horrible the new overseers were. “Kids are going missing,” Jesse declared about three weeks after our arrival. “They’re taking the ones who they think people don’t care about. But I care. I know what they’re up to.”
Rumors began to spread amongst the orphans, with one in particular suggesting that there was a graveyard deep within the forest where children who died during failed experiments were being buried. Austin snuck into Ava and I’s room one night, whispering that Jesse wanted to go find out whether or not it was true. Austin said that he had convinced him to wait until the day when it would mark our six weeks of being back at the orphanage so that “even if it goes wrong, we’ll zap back to the present and have an idea where Jesse’s buried.”
Three weeks later, on the day that marked six weeks since our arrival, the four of us snuck out. Jesse led our expedition. We left through the orphanage’s basement and made our way to a forest path that, according to Jesse, led deeper into the property. The four of us moved in silence and held hands so we wouldn’t lose each other in the night. As we walked, I was able to keep up with the group with ease, not needing to stop in order to catch my breath. I pondered this as we walked. My asthma hadn’t been an issue since I’d first come back to the past. Neither had my eyesight. It seemed as though the changes which had occurred in the past had persisted in the present. I smiled to myself. My Mom would be shocked to find out that our overnight camping trip had cured me of asthma and near-sightedness, gave Austin a haircut and made him grow two inches, plus infused each of our vocabularies with 50s slang. I tapped Ava on the shoulder to whisper this to her, but just as she turned, I spotted a dim light in the trees, no brighter than a flashlight.
BANG.
AThe gunshot came out from nowhere. It tore right through the lower half of Jesse, sending a spray of blood into the air, splattering onto me, Ava, and Austin. The bullet’s force sent Jesse flying backward into Austin, who Ava caught as he staggered. Jesse turned to us, a confused, almost sad expression twisting his face. His eyes met mine. He opened his mouth to speak but only made a gurgling sound. He coughed, and blood splattered on Austin’s chest, who was staring at Jesse in abject horror. Ava whispered weakly, her voice shaking as she stepped backward. “Holy shit.”
Another gunshot rang out into the air, and that was what it took to get the three of us to run. Jesse’s body fell to the ground with a thud, and we left him behind, racing as fast as our legs would allow us back to the orphanage. Gunshot after gunshot sounded off behind us, wood splintering off of bark and shrapnel scraping against our skin as we flew through trees, trying to avoid the gunfire. Austin was in front, Ava and I hot on his heels. But we didn’t know the grounds like we knew the corridors of the orphanage. Austin skidded to a halt on the path as  another fluorescent light appeared in front of us and he whipped around, his eyes wide like a cornered animal’s as he screamed at us to run in the other direction. When the bullet tore through the back of his kneecap, cartilage, and blood splattering the ground, he choked on his own voice. Austin looked down in disbelief at his leg as if he was confused as to why it could no longer support his weight. Ava rushed forward and caught him in her arms as he collapsed, whipping her head around and fixing me with a stare akin to a deer-in-headlights, screaming at me to help.
	I wanted to help, to catch Austin, but I was frozen. So when I began to feel nauseous, my head beginning to hurt, I welcomed it. I staggered forward and grabbed Ava’s hand, closing my eyes and repeatedly whispering, take us back, take us back, please take us back.
 	When I opened my eyes, I was on the gymnasium floor. I bolted upright, gasping for air, whipping my head back and forth. I looked down at my hands. The scratches and bruises I had picked up during our escape were still there. My stomach started to hurt. No. He was fine. I would turn my head, and Austin would be fine and intact. There was no way. He had to be okay.
“Astrid?” Ava whispered my name. I slowly turned my head. She was kneeling over Austin, her eyes wide and her hands covered in blood. Austin was pale and unconscious. His eyes flicked back and forth underneath his eyelids, blood flowing from his leg and pooling beneath him. Ava looked up at me, her hands trembling.
My body moved before my mind did. I knew where the nurse’s office was, and I ran to it, grabbing as many bandages as I could and racing back to my siblings. I used what I had learned from my time in the nurse’s office to make a tourniquet, wrapping the bandages around Austin’s leg to keep him from losing more blood. He mumbled in his sleep, head flopping from one side to the other. “Stay with us, please, stay with us,” I whispered as I added another layer of wrappings to his wounds.
Hours passed. Austin got worse. We searched the orphanage head to toe for any possible clues to point to the gravesite, dumping out desks and clearing out rooms. We found nothing. Ava and I reconvened in the gymnasium together, watching our brother sleep. “We’re going to go back there soon,” I murmured. “It’s almost been six hours.”
“We’ve gotta find where Jesse’s buried.” Ava turned to me with an exhausted look, her voice hoarse. “If Austin dies there, he might die here too. We have to find Jesse.” I nodded. Ava looked back at our brother. “We have to.”

*

Two weeks had passed when we found ourselves back in the orphanage. The men chasing us through the forest had, according to other residents, dragged all three of us back to the courtyard, forced everyone to come outside, and used us as an example to the others of what happened when you tried to sneak out at night. I was glad I wasn’t conscious for that. Jesse never came back. Austin still didn’t wake up. The nursing staff had been slowly fired one by one, and Austin’s care was less than adequate. His leg immediately got infected. By the end of our second week in the past, I had overheard guards talking about cutting it off.
Three weeks in, I was tossing and turning in my bunk, agitated, my mind racing. Where could the graveyard be? I couldn’t risk another midnight expedition. The other kids had all stopped talking about any experiments out in the forest, too scared to risk the wrath of the overseers. Where could it-
THE DRESSER.
The thought came to me so strongly that I had a physical reaction, sitting up in my bunk, hitting my head, and wincing. “The desk. I wrote it down.” I squeezed my eyes shut, digging through my memory. When we first got to the orphanage, the woman who brought us in had stuffed Ava and I’s folder into her desk. Other important documents were probably in there- a map wouldn’t be a stretch. I crawled out of bed and leaned up to the top bunk, shaking Ava awake. “Come on. We need to go,” I whispered. Ava’s eyes snapped open. They were tired and scared. I tried to look confident. “I think I know where the map is.” She nodded, silently slipped out of her bunk, landing quietly on the floor. I grabbed her arm before she made her way to the door. “Hold on.” I grabbed a pair of scissors, standing over one particular dresser. When I was done writing I turned back to Ava. “Let’s go.”
The two of us crept through the hallways, our path illuminated only by moonlight. We got to the office door, and I held the bronze doorknob in my hand. I took a deep breath and tried to turn it. My heart sank as it refused to budge. I closed my eyes and pressed my head against the wall. “It’s locked,” I whispered. My throat ached as I tried not to cry. “I don’t know where the key is.”
Ava leaned forward, running her hands along the door. “You could kick this open.” She turned to me. “The door is just wood, and this lock definitely isn’t all that strong. It’ll be loud, but if I can cause a distraction while you’re knocking it down, keep them away from you, you can find the map and get out of here. Find Jesse and figure out a way to get back before the six weeks are up.” She swallowed hard. “For Austin.”
I stared at her, incredulous. “I’m not going to do that. There’s no way I’m leaving you.” Ava gave me a look. I could see it in her face that she had made her mind up. I shook my head and grabbed her hand. “Ava, please don’t leave me.”
Ava reached out and squeezed my shoulder. “Astrid, you’ve got this.” She smiled, identical to Austin’s, and turned her head. “Hey!” Ava raced down the hallway, her voice carrying through the corridor as she shouted. “I am sick of this orphanage! I’m done with it! I’m leaving, and y-” A guard came barreling down a side hallway towards her and she danced backward out of his grasp, dodging his outstretched arms. She jogged towards the wooden archway and spiral staircase, laughing wholeheartedly. “Ooh, okay! I’ve been wanting to work up a sweat. Let’s go, come on!”
I watched her race down the stairs, listening to her shouts fade. I placed my back on the wall across from the office door, taking a deep breath. Okay. I rushed forward, full force, and slammed my shoulder into the doorframe. White-hot pain shot through my shoulder as the door resisted, and I staggered backward, gritting my teeth. Ow. I repositioned myself and threw my whole body weight into the door again, feeling it start to give. In the distance, I heard someone scream. I closed my eyes. I’ve got this. I rushed forward, tucking my chin into my chest as I used my shoulder to drive my entire body through the door.
The rotting wood flew off its hinges and my momentum drove me into the desk, knocking the wind out of me as it rammed into my midsection. I doubled over, gasping for air. I was pretty sure I had just broken a rib. I coughed and straightened up, tears streaming down my face as I limped around the oak desk, yanking the top drawer open. I started pulling out folders and shaking them out, glancing at the documents as they fell. File, file, file, file, map! A map of the grounds, with an X marked on it and a note that read, “for disposal of bodies.”
I grabbed the map and held it to my chest, closing my eyes. “Okay,” I whispered. “I know where you are, Jesse. I know it hasn’t been six weeks, but you gotta get us back to the present. Do some spirit shit. Get us back, please.” Nothing happened. I could hear voices shouting, boots thudding against the floor. They were coming in my direction. I swallowed hard. “Jesse, please,” My voice cracked. The voices outside got louder. I started to feel nauseous. A guard, face red, balding, his chest heaving, sprinted into the room, a black baton tight in his hand.
	“You,” He spat, his tone venomous. He began to creep towards me, closing the distance between us in the small room, his baton rising. “You and your sister are more trouble than you’re worth.” I started to feel nauseous, and the room began to slowly spin. I willed it to spin faster. The guard lunged at me with a shout, and I fell to the ground, scrambling between his legs. He caught my arm and yanked me upwards, and as I heard the woosh of the stick as it cut through the air towards me, I twisted my head away from him, bracing for the blow. But it never came. I opened my eyes, finding myself on my back, lying on the gymnasium’s wooden floor. I blinked slowly, lifting my watch to my eyes. 6:00 PM, 05/16/2022. I sighed.
	I staggered to my feet, wincing as my ribs ached. I looked to my left. Austin was lying stiffly on the ground, his chest barely moving. Ava was nearby, unconscious, her face sporting a litany of bruises and what looked to be a broken nose. I kneeled down next to her, taking her nearby backpack and lifting it onto my shoulders. I squeezed her hand before I left. Following the map to a tee, I went out through the orphanage basement and found the old forest path. I had to stop often as I hiked, struggling to inhale as what felt like shards of my ribs stabbed into my lungs. But, eventually, I reached a clearing. I looked down at the map. It didn’t say who was buried where.
	“Jesse?” My voice sounded pitiful and weak. I let out an exhausted sigh. “I’m here. Just.. One last thing. Just tell me where you are. Please.” A gust of wind pushed at my shoulder, turning me to the left. Another gust pushed into my back, and I staggered forwards until, eventually, I was standing over a patch of dirt by a stream. I fell to my knees and pulled a spade out from my backpack. I dug until my hands ached, but the dirt came up, and soon I found myself staring at a grinning skeleton. I reached into the grave, my fingers hooking the dog tags around the skeleton’s neck and yanking them off. “Found you,” I whispered. I held the dog tags to my chest.
I carefully lifted the bones out of the grave, slipping them into my backpack. The second walk was even more excruciating than the first. But I found my way back. By the time I’d returned, Ava had limped out with Austin out into the courtyard, and she lifted her hand to wave at me as I made way towards her. I waved back. And when we dragged ourselves back to our car, laying Austin in the back, Ava sliding behind the wheel and me in the passenger seat, I looked in the rearview mirror. And I swore, just on the edge of the forest, I could see a lanky boy with hazel eyes and a pearly white smile waving to us as we drove away.

Chinamanenji hachifambisi
Shona Proverb: The mysterious are not hasty

Isaac went to St. Georges on a rainy Monday morning. The week before he left was full of anxiety, and subdued happiness, with the threat of a storm hanging on the horizon. Every day, the clouds gathered and darkened, and sometimes gusts of wind would pick up suddenly, shaking the Musasa tree from side to side. We did not talk much during that week and the house was often quiet, punctuated by the mechanical tap of Isaac’s calculator knocking against the study desk in his room and the wind whistling in the leaves outside. Even though school had not yet started for him, Isaac was already reading ahead, flipping furiously through the textbooks that Babamunini Jacob had bought for him. “That boy is industrious,” Baba would say occasionally before going into a monologue about how fitting it was that Babamunini Jacob was sending Isaac to boarding school.
Babamunini Jacob came on Friday to take Isaac and Baba to town so they could buy new uniforms. Amai’s hand was no longer swollen by then, but she still had it wrapped in a loose arm sling, made out of her plaid dhuku which she tied around her neck. When she went to greet Babamunini at the gate, she had another dhuku, a brown one with yellow specks, wrapped around her head to cover the half of her face that sagged from her bruised cheek. Her black eye had not completely healed but the skin around it no longer looked like a ripening avocado. Babamunini noticed it immediately. I saw it, the smile half-frozen on his face and the way his eyes widened a little beneath the large frame of his glasses. Baba was standing close to him, leaning on the door of the car with his hand on the roof, as if it was his. Babamunini turned suddenly and gripped Baba’s neck without warning, choking him until his eyes looked like the fish Amai brought from the market, as if they could pop out at any moment.
“Are you crazy Zechariah? You want to rot in jail handi! We talked about this! This is the last time…”
Babamunini stopped speaking and released his grip when he noticed me, peering furtively from behind the pillar on the verandah. Baba coughed violently until small tears formed at the corners of his eyes. He did not look like someone capable of punching Amai then, just a fat, weak man and Babamunini looked so strong, like the black and white Muhammad Ali poster in Isaac’s room. It was hard to imagine that Babamunini Jacob was Baba's younger brother at that moment. Amai went to get water for Baba who was still coughing and breathing heavily. I saw a smile on her face as she went inside. Babamunini Jacob had gone into the car and was sitting behind the steering wheel, clasping and unclasping his hands on its leather edges. Isaac came out then, oblivious to what had transpired and entered the car. Baba went in without accepting the glass of water from Amai. The engine roared to life as if nothing had happened.
Amai stopped me from going with them, that Friday and the Saturday afterwards, when they went to buy Isaac’s trunk and the food he would be carrying to school. “They are already taking my Isaac, they will not take you away too,” she exclaimed ominously, as if I would disappear behind the dark tint of Babamunini Jacob’ sedan. As I listened to Isaac narrating how they had gone to Meikles Hotel for lunch and how Babamunini had promised to take him to his house in Borrowdale after schools closed, I imagined that I could, that I would disappear in his car and appear somewhere else, maybe in his house or maybe in boarding school too.
 Saturday was full of packing and unpacking, ticking off the items on the list sent from the school and shoving them into the black trunk which bore Isaac’s name in neat calligraphy. Babamunini Jacob was paying the school fees to St. Georges, which cost twice as much as Baba’s salary from his last job. Baba said it was because Isaac had always worked hard at school. As I helped Amai to pack, folding the white t-shirts into neat squares and stacking them in the monarch, I wondered whether he had said that to placate me, or to chastise me for not getting an offer from Babamunini Jacob to be sent to St. Georges.
Amai had insisted on ironing the new uniforms, so the plastic packaging was torn off and the uniforms pressed to her standard. Teachers at Tongogara Government School always commented on how smart Isaac was. Once, a teacher had asked if we were related, and why my shoes always seemed dusty, and my tie was always loose. After that, Isaac started going to school with an extra set of shoe polish in his school bag. When we were a street away from the school gate, he would adjust my tie and dust my shoes. He usually used the money Babamunini Jacob slipped in his shorts to buy the polish.
 Isaac woke me up early that morning when the stars still shone through the maze of leaves outside my window. I watched the dainty branches of the Musasa tree trying to chase away the sleep from my eyes. A small breeze was blowing, and they swayed from side to side, reminding me of the rheumatic choirmaster’s hands that quivered during the school assembly as we sang the national anthem. I suddenly realized that there would be no one to talk to about school events anymore. Isaac spoke so softly that it took some time for me to realize that he was speaking. I realized that he was nearly crying because his voice was shaking. I did not know what to do.
“You should pretend that you are not well, like we do when we don’t want to go to church,” I whispered, trying to chase away the discomfort of the situation.
“You know that will not work….. I am scared of leaving home and going so far away,” he whispered back. The silence fell again, and I focused on the soft gusts of Isaac’s labored breathing that were brushing against my face.
When Isaac finally spoke, his voice had changed. It was stern now and I could tell that the idea of not going to school had been removed.
“I don’t know. I think I want to go; it’s a good school and I could never get this chance again. If I have to become a doctor, I need to go to St. Georges.”
“Or a lawyer.... besides you are coming back soon, and we will have the whole holiday to ourselves”, I said as I put my arm over his neck, although my mind was wondering whether any lawyers, or more importantly any writers, had ever attended Tongogara.
If I had known better, I would never have said the last part. It got cooler and I could hear mosquitoes buzzing in my ears, but we stayed like that for a while, Isaac curled above the cotton duvet in the twilight. Streaks of sunlight were breaking through the branches of the peach tree and dancing on the walls when Isaac snuggled into my bed, the way I had always done when I was scared. There was no one to pull us apart like Baba had done then, calling me a coward for being scared of the dark. I had never been afraid of the dark, but of the noises that came when night fell, and the stifled screams that escaped from the main bedroom next to mine.
On those nights when Baba tore us apart, Isaac always told me to look at the moon. “Just know I will be looking at the same moon too, so as long as you see the moon, know I am here.” I turned to the window and saw the thin crescent of a new moon hanging in the sky. I realized for the first time that Isaac and I had never stared at the moon together because his window was on the other side of the house. I also realized that the moon was not always there. Maybe Isaac would not always be there too. Still, I whispered in his ear, “Remember to look at the moon,” and then I drifted into sleep.
 I did not notice when Isaac left, because when I woke up all that remained were crumpled sheets. I went into the dining room, looking for him. The clouds had returned, casting dark shadows inside the house. It was raining now, not the violent outburst we had expected, but gently, as if the clouds too had resigned to their fate. At the beginning of every school term, Baba would make us stand in front of him as he sat on his sofa. He would show us the receipts of our school fees first and then make us look at our school reports before he signed them. Then he would ask us what we wanted to be when we grew up. I remembered that on my first day to school, I had said “when I grow up, I want to be Isaac.” Everyone laughed, of course, but I had meant it. A part of me still wanted to be him. To be the intelligent one, the one who got to go to boarding school, the one Babamunini Jacob slipped money to.
That day it was different. Baba was sitting on the carpet across from Isaac. They were both barefoot and cross-legged, and Baba was holding a small packet of bute. He took out a pinch and sniffed it, first with the left nostril and then with the other.
“My fathers, those in the wind, here is your son. I give you charge over him, not that I am no longer his father but because you see what I cannot.” He took a handful of snuff and poured it onto the carpet in a straight line.
“Guide his feet and clear his path, as you have done for Jacob, his Babamunini.”
 He took another handful of bute and sprinkled it onto the carpet.
“You know that my hope lies in him and in him only. Ziwewera, keep him as you kept me in the war.”
Baba took a handful and spread it on the carpet. Afterwards, he snuffed the bute once more and spread it around his head using his palms. I left the doorway then and headed outside through the backyard door, wondering whether I would ever be Baba’s hope. Amai sat in the backyard that morning, under the Musasa tree. Small water droplets were dropping from the leaves onto her polka dot dress, but she did not seem to notice. They had already formed an O shape on her back, the one that always formed when she did the laundry or worked in the garden or tended the rose patch; the roses she only pruned after Baba beat her, always without gloves. I went and stood by her side, touching her shoulder slightly. She quickly wiped off her tears and took me between her arms. I was too old to sit on her lap and if Baba found me in her embrace, he would call me soft. I softly nudged her arms away and sat on a wet stone nearby instead. We sat there in silence, receiving the drops of rain falling from the tree and holding hands.
It was the hum of the jeep that broke us out of our reverie. Babamunini raised his hand to us as he stepped out of the car, but Amai remained forlorn. Mainini Elizabeth came towards us, removing her shades as she struggled with her heeled shoes on the gravel. Her mouth opened a little when she saw Amai’s face. The swelling had disappeared, and her eye had opened up, but the black edge was faintly visible. I wanted to go and get her a chair, but she declined. She opened her mouth to speak but could not. Her face portrayed the message; we had all thought the beatings were a thing of the past. She tried to open her mouth again but just then, Babamunini Jacob called her, his baritone reverberating on the walls. She smiled sadly and removed the shades that were now tucked on the neck of her blouse and put them on Amai's face. Then she patted her back a little and walked to the car. It was time. I wanted to go and say goodbye to Isaac, to hug him so tight until I heard his heartbeat against my chest. I didn’t. I watched as Babamunini Jacob’s driver loaded the trunk and monarchs into the jeep. I raised my hand, but Isaac didn’t wave back. I wished I had run to hug him then. But Baba wouldn’t have approved and Amai’s hand held mine in a tight grip as if she was afraid they would decide to take me too. It was after the car had left, with Baba and Isaac, that we walked towards the gate, still holding hands. Amai was singing softly, as we stared down the road, looking for the car that we knew had already left. Only the Musasa trees remained, lining the boulevard in irregular clumps, and dropping little tears to the ground. That was the day Amai pulled out the roses, still singing but now crying as well.




Rine manyanga hariputirwe mushunje
 Shona proverb: - That which has horns cannot be concealed in a bundle of grass

Isaac went to the hospital on a sunny Sunday morning.  At home, the arguments resurfaced; frequent now and louder. They started on simple issues, like the day Baba sent me out in the evening to buy his cigarettes. It was a Monday, two weeks after Isaac’s accident. Amai was in the kitchen, preparing supper. She called me as I passed the white kitchen door.
“Ishmael come and sit here,” she mouthed, wiping her hands on her apron, and pulling out a chair.
“But Baba...”
“If he wants a cigarette, he will have to go and buy it himself”.
She continued dicing the onions and tomatoes.
Baba coughed unconvincingly from the dining room.
“Isaac, eh Ishmael, where are my cigarettes?” he said, his voice carrying a hint of annoyance from the sitting room to the kitchen.
“What cigarettes, Ba’mwana?”
She grabbed the coins from my hand and went with them to the dining room. “You want them all, hee? You want to eat them all. You sent Isaac to die, now you want to kill my Ishmael too. I will not let it happen,” Amai said, her voice rising higher with every word.
“I will....” Baba began to say then stopped.
“What? What haven’t you done before? Kill me then and we will see where the money to buy the next cigarette will come from. Don’t patronize me Zechariah, I may not be the head of this house, but I am the breadwinner.”
I had never seen Amai speak out to Baba. It was exciting and scary at the same time, like when Isaac had taught me how to ride a bicycle by letting go of the seat behind me. It was a taste of freedom with the subconscious feeling that something bad could happen soon afterwards.
Baba stood up and raised his hand, as if to strike Amai. She did not cower or back off. Instead, she pushed her face close to Baba’s fist, wringing her own hands into fists. Baba opened his mouth and dropped his hand.
 “So, it is like that now?” Baba asked no one before he went out and bought the cigarettes himself. The arguments were no longer one sided and Amai no longer needed Mainini Elizabeth’s shades. It had been like that ever since the roses had been uprooted.

*

After the accident, Mainini Elizabeth started visiting us frequently, helping with the cooking and cleaning and staying with me when Amai and Baba went to the hospital. Amai unlocked Isaac’s room on Tuesday. She mopped the floor and Mainini Elizabeth applied the red floor polish after her. They washed all of Isaac’s sheets and blankets in a huge enamel basin that Mainini Elizabeth had bought for us. I watched them, holding their skirts high and stepping repeatedly on the blankets in the basin. They were singing, as they changed the water and squeezed the blankets, holding them by the corners and twisting them in opposite directions. It reminded me of when we were young, when Isaac and I would beg to step on the blankets, wearing nothing except our underwear. Amai never refused. She would bathe us afterwards, out there in the sun, removing the soap surds left by the washing powder on our bodies. She would make us stand on the lawn and place her finger in front of the hose pipe to form a jet of water which she pointed at us.

A sofa was removed from the dining room and the mattress Babamunini had bought for Isaac was laid in its place. Isaac had been given a week by the school to recover.
Isaac came in the jeep on Wednesday. He was thinner and darker, walking slowly and still wearing his St. George's blazer which looked a little baggy now. Babamunini would not allow anyone to help Isaac but himself. He almost lifted him, but Isaac protested weakly. No one was telling Isaac to be a man, not even Baba. They let him grunt and moan.
The first two days, I barely talked to him. There was a constant stream of people coming to our house to see him. They were people from church, teachers and students from Tongogara and neighbors down the street. A few teachers and students from St. Georges came too, the ones who would stare awkwardly around the house, trying to mask their curiosity by stealing a few glances at the house, at the fading paint and sun beaten curtains then looking back at Isaac or Amai or me. I could tell that they could not understand how someone like Isaac could come from a place like this. Isaac would usually sleep after the people left. On the few occasions he was awake with no one around, Amai stopped me from talking to him saying he needed to rest.
Babamunini and Mainini Elizabeth came every day that week. They would bring fruits for Isaac and a crate of beer which Baba drank under the Musasa tree with Babamunini. Sometimes, Amai would chase them away to lay Isaac’s mattress on a reed mat in the shade.
I talked to Isaac eventually one day, the Friday after he had come. He was no longer sleeping on the mattress, and he walked normally now. I found him sitting on my bed when I came from school. The sun was dancing on the walls and on Isaac’s face which was now shades lighter than mine and on the leather chess board where he had set the scratched pieces.
We played the first game in silence, sharing the yogurt that Babamunini had bought for Isaac.
“What happened?” I asked, slurping on the yogurt.
“What did they tell you?” Isaac asked, moving his queen sideways and handing me the spoon.
I moved my own and put him in check. “Nothing.”
He heaved, moving his knight slowly with his face contorted with concentration. Somehow, I knew that he was fifteen moves ahead of me, at least.
“St. Georges is different from Tongogara. There are only twenty people in my class. Eleven are white and most of the blacks don’t consider themselves black. It’s better not to be too black. It was easier for me at first, because I could pass for colored because of my skin. Most of them thought I was Babamunini’s son anyway, so I fit in among the rich kids. But they soon learnt. I could not use the fork and knife properly; I could not relate to some of their stories about holidays spent in London or Cape Town or the…...”
He paused again, breathing heavily, more out of emotion than exhaustion. His voice was becoming shaky.
“You don’t have to tell me, Isaac.”
“No, you have to know. Maybe someday they will decide to send you there too. It is a good school. We don’t share textbooks. There is everything you would need, and the teachers don’t skip lessons like at Tongogara. But there is bullying too. Especially if you’re poor. There were some boys who had scholarship grants. Many transferred and most of the few remaining are now day scholars. They came for me at night, after lights out. They beat me with wet towels, shoes, and hockey sticks because I had not observed Founders Day. I didn’t even know about Founders Day. It is some holiday they used to celebrate in Rhodesia, but apparently it is still important for most of them. Then someone suggested the swimming pool. I don’t remember much, but the boy who found me said they locked me in a trunk and threw it into the pool.”
I imagined being in a dark and cold trunk and gasping for air. I shuddered.
“Does Amai know?” I whispered, afraid that the walls would hear.
“They told her I slipped into the pool. The school has agreed to expel the students quietly so they cannot tell anyone. You can’t tell Amai. I need to go back to learn, Ishmael.” he murmured, emotionless and with a blank face.
I wanted to protest. I was angry that Isaac could be so selfish with his own life. Did he know how Amai came crying to my room, how we had done novenas and rosaries as he lay in the hospital, how I had had nightmares ever since he had been in hospital? Then I realized he was right too. There was nothing for him at Tongogara. We were sixty students in a class meant for forty, there were no textbooks, no library and the teachers missed lessons regularly. But most of all he was a doctor, Baba’s doctor.  He had to make it no matter the cost. Baba didn’t know or care about his debate captaincy or how he wanted to be a lawyer. Maybe he didn’t even know about the bullying.
“But Babamunini Jacob is such a powerful man, and he can do something about this....”
“He knows, Ishmael, he has always known. Checkmate”

*

Isaac came back with nightmares. The arguments were replaced by Isaac’s loud screams in the night. Amai no longer slept in the main bedroom. She slept on a chair in the hallway, outside Isaac’s room. When he had nightmares, she would call me to his room, and we would all kneel on the floor and do the rosary.  Mama would begin the decade, then I would follow, and Isaac would do the third one. Mainini Elizabeth brought incense, which Mama placed in an empty coca cola bottle at the end of the room. It burnt all night, seeping into the hallway and into my room. During the day, when the smell of freshly applied floor polish still hung in the air and when the scent of incense was beginning to fade away, Baba would take a handful of coarse salt into Isaac’s room. Some was sprinkled beneath the door, in every corner of the room, on the windowsills and under Isaac’s pillow. “Salt chases away evil spirits and witches,” Mainini Elizabeth told me when she caught me spying on Baba through the gap on the door as he was sprinkling the salt. She still came to help Amai with the chores.

*

It was Baba’s idea. He said Isaac had been bewitched and we needed to seek help. Babamunini tried to talk him out of it, but he was adamant.
He first brought a local pastor who owned one of the many Pentecostal churches in town. He came on Isaac’s last weekend with us. Despite Amai’s pleas that Isaac needed to rest, Baba went to pick up the pastor with Babamunini. They came back in a procession of cars filled with members of the church. Babamunini left as the people entered our yard giving an inaudible excuse while he went to his car. I did not really listen because I was fascinated by the group of people that was entering our yard. It hardly looked like they had been invited impromptu for the prayer meeting. Most were in their Sunday best; Ankara attires and stuffy suits that looked uncomfortable but expensive. There were so many people that the air in the dining room quickly became suffocating and hot. Imported colognes and perfumes competed in the room until Amai told some of them to leave the room, opening the windows and the front door to let the cool March air in and push some of the church people out. They went outside reluctantly, mumbling among themselves and casting furtive glances from her to Isaac who was sitting on the sofa. He looked sullen as he stared back at the people. When all the people had positioned themselves in all the places that allowed them to see their prophet at work, the singing began. A short woman led the singing in a shrill voice and the others joined in. It was not necessary because within minutes everyone was speaking in tongues and pacing around the room. Those outside were banging on the walls and clapping their hands while shouting inconceivable words. From the corner of the room, I could see a smirk on Amai’s face. Isaac saw it too and Mainini Elizabeth did too until all of us were silently laughing.  The church members did not notice because they all had their eyes shut, including the pastor who was spewing out Bible verses and binding invisible demons. The pastor cleared his throat, and all was suddenly calm again.
“Brothers and sisters, today we are gathered at the request of brother Zechariah. We all know that what happened to brother Isaac was the work of the devil. The spirit is revealing to me...” he said and paused for effect, wiping his face with a white napkin that had yellowed from sweat.
All the time the people were shouting ‘Holy Ghost fire’, shaking their heads and muttering prayers beneath their breaths at intervals.
“The spirit has told me that this was the work of ancestral spirits. There is an ancestral spirit chasing this family,” he shouted. Some of the women started crying as if they knew Isaac.
The pastor began shaking and the crowd resumed their prayer. Several of them walked over to Isaac and placed their hands on his head. Isaac looked more irritated rather than possessed. It went on like that for a long time until I could hear my stomach grumbling in protest. The pastor cleared his throat and the room fell silent once more.
“Brother Isaac, rise and receive the blessed anointing oil,” the pastor said, taking a small bottle from the pocket of his plaid suit.
Isaac rose with some exaggerated difficulty, clutching the armrest for support. Mainini Elizabeth went and supported him, taking his hands into hers. The prophet put a little of the oil into his hands and drew a cross on Isaac’s forehead while gently pushing him back. He did not fall down like the people at the churches from the television did. He stood firm and I could see Mainini Elizabeth trying to stop the prophet’s arm from physically performing its miracle. The prophet tried again and still Isaac did not thrash about as the people from his church would do. He stood calmly and the silence in the room frayed from the mumblings of shocked church members, some of whom were still praying. The prophet spoke slowly, placing the anointed oil into his pocket.
“Eh...Sister Miriam, please give us a song,” the pastor murmured weakly.
The short lady sang a Shona song this time. The mood had changed, and the people did not respond with as much enthusiasm. They soon left after that, still murmuring inaudibly. Isaac and I laughed that night about the failed miracle."

    <string name="takuS2">"“Isn’t it funny that all poor ancestors become ancestral spirits? If they had left us an inheritance, they would not have been ancestral spirits,” Isaac said, rubbing his arms.
 “They are still in chains. They were in chains on the white man’s farms and mines, now we bind and cast them in chains again in the white man’s gospel,” I said quietly. Isaac looked at me in disbelief.
“Was it my absence that brought out this side of you? I think we must call the pastor again to bind the spirit of talkativeness in you,” Isaac said, and we laughed, more than we had ever had in a long time. We laughed until the moon shone through the curtains, until the noise from the shebeens had died down, until Baba came in and dragged me by the ear to my own room.
The following day, Baba invited a Madzibaba who operated a sowe close to the salon. He lived in Kuwadzana, all the way across town, yet he operated near the Avenues because he knew that the people there had more money. All he had to do was to divine marital problems, unemployment or failing businesses or financial difficulties based on the appearance of his visitors or the gossip that floated out of the salon where his wife worked. Amai pointed this out for Baba, but he remained adamant. Mainini Elizabeth agreed to fetch the Madzibaba from Kuwadzana in her car. They came on Wednesday, which was usually Madzibaba's Sabbath. Isaac was supposed to go back to St. Georges that Friday. Baba was getting desperate then, talking about visiting a traditional healer, to which Babamunini vehemently refused.
You could tell that Madzibaba was a member of an apostolic sect because he had a shaved head that caught the last rays of twilight, a long black beard with white specks and he was wearing white robes that were tied around his waist by a tree bark. He had a clay pot in one hand, black with chevron patterns painted on its sides. He also held a long walking stick which was hooked at the end. He had no shoes and brown dust was clinging to his gemenzi and chapped feet. I wondered how Mainini Elizabeth had managed to sit with him in her car alone. Amai did not allow him into the house, so he sat under the Musasa tree, tending his fire, and boiling a lemon and honey mixture in the clay pot. Mainini Elizabeth was chatting to Amai who was cleaning the pots outside. There had been no electricity that afternoon, so she was cleaning the soot from the kango pots. I hated the sound of the sand rubbing against the enamel pots, but my attention was caught by the Madzibaba. I peered at him through the lace curtain taking care not to draw attention to myself. He looked like a ghost in the fading daylight, tall and silent but ominous. I imagined that the magoritoto that Amai always told us about would look like him. Isaac joined me by the window. We had not been told why he had come but we both knew that he had come for Isaac.
“Do you think that is for me?” he asked, eyeing the pot with forlorn eyes.
“Yes. Will you eat it?”
Just then Baba entered and beckoned Isaac to follow him. I watched their silhouettes cast by the fire, the flickering light dancing on their clothes. Amai came and stood beside me, placing her hand on my shoulder.  We went outside. Isaac was sitting on a reed mat, with small, rounded pebbles in his hands. The man was addressing spirits to the east and west, throwing the honey and lemon concoction towards the blood red orb of the dying sun.
He addressed Baba first.
“It is good that you have joined us because everyone has to hear this. Call your Mainini.”
Mainini Elizabeth joined us, pulling her skirt down and trying to act reverent in her heels.
“This family is under a curse. The spirit has told me that you have another sister who is jealous of you and has bewitched you. You also named this boy after a great ancestral spirit; your great grandfather Isaac and his spirit wants to possess this boy. I cannot do anything at the moment because a lot of work needs to be done. I will need other things, first a white goat with no specks, three white chickens, a crate of white eggs and ...” He spoke in an animated way, and the words flowed easily out of his mouth as if he was reciting a speech rather than interpreting a divination.
He did not finish the last statement because Baba had jumped onto the reed mat and gripped his neck.  He also tipped the pot on the fire and the fire was put out violently, sending a cloud of smoke and ash shooting up into the Musasa tree. The man shrieked and tried to free himself.  Mainini Elizabeth was cursing under her breath, using a handkerchief to remove little pieces of ash that had stuck on her dress. Baba let go of the man who scampered towards the gate and into the darkness, leaving his clay pot behind. Isaac stood from the reed mat. The electricity came just then, and the light on the verandah illuminated the scene. Everyone was covered in ash, but Isaac had received most of it. We laughed a lot during supper, talking about the man who had lied. It was a good feeling, forgetting about the argument and screams that would come later at night. Mainini Elizabeth stayed for supper. I had never imagined that she ate sadza like we did, with her long acrylic nails digging into the meal and forming perfectly rounded scoops of maize meal.
“Isaac is not going back to St. Georges until we find out the problem,” Baba said abruptly, choking the laughter in the room. Mainini placed her drumstick down and wiped her mouth with a little napkin she had taken from her handbag.  Amai pushed her plate to the center of the table. “What?” she asked, grabbing a glass of water.
“You heard me. I said Isaac will not be going to St Georges on Friday,” Baba said a little louder, chewing the chicken bones loudly. He wiped soup from his chin with the back of his hand and picked another bone.
“I think we need to involve Jacob in this,” Mainini Elizabeth said softly, taking the chipped enamel washing bowl and washing her hands briskly. Amai did not say anything, but she had stopped eating, just like Isaac and everyone else at the table except Baba.
“Is Jacob the father of the child, hee?” he hissed.
Mainini paused a little, then stammered and paused again.
“Well, he is the one who offered to pay for Isaac’s education so he must be informed,” Amai finally said, offering Mainini Elizabeth the drying towel. She left soon after, and the rest of the meal was finished in silence.
I did not sleep that night and neither did Baba and Amai. They argued all night and I could hear the faint echoes of their voices bouncing on the walls and spilling into my room. Isaac did not scream that night.
When the sun was about to rise, there was a long shadow on the walls of my room. I could see it near the door before it began moving and became a blur. The shadow got closer, and I was almost screaming when Isaac whispered.
“Are you awake Ishmael?”
“Yes. I cannot sleep,” I whispered back.
The voices from the room across the hallway had died down to small hums that could not get past the door. Isaac slid into my blankets.
“You did not scream last night,” I whispered again, wriggling towards the wall to make room for Isaac.
“Yes. I didn’t have the nightmare. I dreamt about the Musasa tree,” he said, louder now.
“What do you see when you scream?” I asked.
“I don’t know; I usually forget,” he whispered, then turned away to look up. I knew he was lying but I did not ask him. Sleep was making my eyelids heavy, but I fought it.
“Isaac, tell me your dream...”
There was a long silence, and then Isaac rolled back and faced me. I had closed my eyes, but I could tell that he was looking at me.
“We were in the Musasa tree, sitting on opposite branches. It seemed as if the tree was dying and alive at the same time, because you were sitting on a branch with browning leaves while I was sitting on one with green leaves. You tried to come to my branch, but you couldn’t because Baba appeared and pulled you back. Then I woke up.”

*

There was no electricity when Mainini Elizabeth and Babamunini Jacob came that day. We were all sitting on the veranda outside, listening to the chirping crickets and fighting mosquitoes. The house still felt empty even though we were all here. Amai had prepared Isaac’s uniform that afternoon, wearing her polka dot dress and singing loudly. She had also instructed him to pack his clothes in a monarch suitcase. I thought maybe it was because he would be going back to school, so she did not want his clothes to become dusty on the wardrobe shelves. Mainini Elizabeth’s car stopped outside, followed by Babamunini Jacob’ car. Mainini was still in her uniform from work and Babamunini looked like he had just left the courtroom.
“Do you think Baba will allow me to go back to St. Georges tomorrow?” Isaac whispered.
“Yes. He wants you to be a doctor after all. Do you want to go back?”
Baba cleared his throat looking at me and I quickly shut up.
Babamunini followed closely behind Mainini Elizabeth, talking to her in hushed tones. In the dining room, Amai had lit a candle and placed it on an empty beer bottle. We waited by the door waiting for Babamunini Jacob and Mainini Elizabeth to enter first, but they stopped too behind us. Mainini motioned for us to get in with his hand. I could not help but notice the criss crossing veins etched on her hands. They seemed to throb in the waning glow of the twilight. I must have been staring because she cleared her throat and I hurried inside, hoping that Baba had not seen me. Everyone went in and settled down but Mainini and Babamunini remained outside for a while.
They came in moments later, Babamunini wiping his spectacles with a napkin and Mainini Elizabeth adjusting the black zambia around her waist. Babamunini Jacob asked that Isaac and I  leave the room, but Baba stopped us.
“Why should they leave? They must stay here and listen. After all we are talking about Isaac, and Ishmael has to know too.”
I was as surprised that Baba had mentioned me as I was that he had not done what Babamunini Jacob had requested.
“It is ok, Zechariah. Besides, we don’t want to waste time here. Your wife and I have agreed that Isaac should resume school soon, maybe this week. Of course, a doctor will have to assure us that he is fit. He cannot continue to be at home like this.”
“Since when do women make decisions in this family Jacob, since when? Did you even consider that it is my son you are talking about?” Baba asked, his voice rising. I noticed Babamunini touching his napkin as if to wipe his spectacles. His hands stopped in mid-air, and he brought them down and wiped them on his trousers.
“Don’t hold on to old fashioned ideas, Zechariah. We are all educated people here. You don’t have to show us that you are the only one without a university degree!” Babamunini snapped. Baba laughed, his hoarse voice rising up from deep down his chest until his belly seemed to laugh too.
“Old fashioned? If only degrees could buy you sons! Did your degree help you when you wanted to leave your wife because you did not have a son, Jacob?”
Amai stood up and sighed. "This is a waste of time, Elizabeth, Jacob. I told you we need to bring the priest here so he can help us settle this."
“Priest? What priest, and in whose house? By my dead father’s grave, no priest shall step foot in this house. I told you, Isaac must be seen by a n’anga first before I can allow him to go back to that school. He must be given protective charms against ngozi.” Baba was standing now, waving his arms in the air as he spoke.
“Calm down Zechariah. There are children here,” Amai berated.
“I agree. Zechariah, please calm down. Would you rather have us pay someone, the way we did that prophet and that Madzibaba you assaulted?” Babamunini asked, kissing his teeth and clicking his tongue in anger.
Baba was breathing heavily now and his whole frame was shaking as he swayed from side to side.
“It has always been good for you, this church, has it not? The white priests and nuns dotted over you there at St. Stephens. You were always the golden boy. That will not work in my house. You never liked me Jacob. You and mother. It was always Jacob this, Jacob that. I had no peace,  I have never had peace, not even now. At school it was always, ‘why are you not like Jacob, your brother?’ At home, it was always, ‘why are you not like Jacob?’ My wife asks me why I am not like you. My friends ask me why I am not like you.  I have never been good enough for all of you.”
Babamunini sprang up like a lion ready to pounce. He stood with his face in front of Baba, waving his finger in front of him while he spoke through clenched teeth.
“Leave my mother out of this. Yes, maybe I don’t like you and all the shame you have brought to this family; beating your wife who feeds and provides for you. And poor Ishmael! God only knows what that boy did to deserve how you treat him. But leave my mother out of this!”
Baba paused for a moment, thinking of what to say next.
“It started well before that. You always thought you were both better than me, with your better academic reports and academic prizes. To you, I was always a failure…” he finally muttered in a low voice.
“Well, I was not exactly wrong, was I? Where are you now? Did you get anything out of the stupid articles you wrote? Where were you when I was getting grants to study in England? Spending all your time writing books that would never get published! Where did that take you, hee? Writing and writing while some of us were busy doing what mattered. Maybe that is why you do not like Ishmael, you see so much of yourself in him, and in his love of writing,” Babamunini said, laughing with spite. Baba looked at me briefly. There was sadness in his eyes.
“Where was I? Where was I, you ask. Was I not in the war with you, Jacob? Before that, did any of you support me with my writing? Did you get anything out of education either? Everything you have came from the war, the same war that we fought; you, me, and everyone else. Yet you were the only winner. You got sent to university, here and abroad. You got positions and properties, here and abroad. But here I am. You are just jealous. It’s not my fault Jacob that you don’t have children. You spent too much time reading books and waiting for some imaginary girl from the war you wanted to marry and when you did marry someone else, you could not bring yourself to have children with her. And how dare you tell me about Ishmael, you know that I have always doubted that he is my son. There is nothing about that boy that looks like me.”
There it was, the answer to all of my life’s misgivings, wrapped subtly in the yells and shouts. Isaac squeezed my hand tighter when Baba said it and Baba avoided staring at me. I wanted to cry but I could not.
Babamunini took out his napkin and started wiping his spectacles, clinically, starting with the frame before moving to the lens.
“What war? Didn’t you run away from the war? And what about your wife? You continue battering her. How can you say Ishmael is not your son? Whose son is he then? Was your irrationality his fault? You made up for your own fears and regrets by making his life hard Zechariah, because you could not bear to see how much he was like you when he started writing, and deep down you know it. Maybe we did not support you, but we did not try to beat the writing out of you.”
“Get out, get out of my house!” Baba bellowed, pacing the room and clenching his fists. Mainini Elizabeth stood next to Babamunini Jacob, her hands wiping the tears flowing down her face. I had not noticed that she was crying.
“Jacob and Elizabeth, I said get out of my house! I don’t want you to step foot in this yard ever again!” Baba said, loosening the buttons around his neck and wrists and rolling up his sleeves.
“I am leaving Zechariah. But don’t ever come begging me for any assistance ever again. Chasing me out of the house I helped you to get? You can keep it, keep it all! But I’m taking my son and my wife with me. Mine! My son! My wife!”
“What…” Baba stuttered, his face displaying the confusion we all had.
“Yes. I did meet that woman Zechariah, the one I had always wanted to marry. Mary, your wife, my first love. How do you think I felt, watching you abuse her all this time hee? I met her on your wedding day, I let you marry her and what did you do? You beat her. But she gave me something you cannot take from me. Yes, Isaac is my son! Do you think I was just being generous,  paying his school fees, buying him all those things, and even naming him hee? He is mine! And I’m taking him and Mary. Come Isaac, come Mary, let’s go.”

The truth did not settle in quietly, the way the dust did on the windowsills after the August whirlwinds. It crashed down heavily, the way the Musasa branch had done when the first rains came. For a moment I thought I could not breathe and when I did it felt like my chest was on fire. Isaac took my hand and squeezed it, but I could not do the same. I was numb. Mainini was the first to leave. She got up, slapped Babamunini on the face then walked out sobbing loudly. Soon after, we heard the screech of her tires, fighting against the potholed road and speeding into the night. Isaac sat wide-eyed on the sofa, hardly blinking. Baba crashed into the sofa holding his head in his hands. He started sobbing, the sofa creaking as he heaved. Suddenly, he started laughing, holding his hand to his mouth while tears flowed from his eyes. Amai did not cry. She went to the bedroom and took the packed bags.  Babamunini took Amai and Isaac’s hands and went out the door into the dark night. I stood up to follow but Baba pulled me back. I did not fight him; I had never been meant to go. Soon after, the sound of the engine revving up and tires squealing could be heard fading in the distance. Baba went out, taking the key and locking me inside the house.
I did not sleep that night. I stayed up until dawn broke through the curtains, listening to the silence. It echoed loud laughter from the kitchen, people praying in tongues and banging walls and the hushed tones of novenas and rosaries. I was afraid of going out, afraid of disobeying Baba. I realized that without Isaac, I would have never disobeyed Baba on anything.  I finally went out through the backdoor when I could not bear to be alone with my thoughts anymore.  I found him that morning. He had hung himself on the Musasa tree with his belt. That is when I cried a flood of tears, rising up from the place which should and could have loved my father in his lifetime. Tears for the brother I had never had yet whom I had lost. Tears for a mother I realized I had never really known. But most importantly, tears for me, because I saw myself hanging on the Musasa tree, a man who could never love because he had never been truly loved.





Pachapwa madziva miramba tichanyurura
Shona Proverb: -When pools dry up, we pick out the bream

The postman dutifully delivers the mail every Friday, in the last week of the month. Today the kombi is taking too long to fill up with people and I am late. I am nervous, almost jittery, so I try to concentrate on the kombi conductor chanting rapidly at the men and women passing by while hanging precariously on the minibus door with one hand. In another life, he would have been a rap artist.
My thoughts drift to the mail. I imagine that Amai has finally written to me. When I am about to open her imaginary letter, the kombi suddenly comes to life, all the passengers are jerked forward, and I am violently shaken out of my daydream. A woman holding a small baby and wearing a weather-beaten shirt from some previous election campaign complains but the conductor rudely tells her to buy her own car if she doesn’t like public transport. “Better still, you can vote wiser next time,” he says, as he collects money from the front row, and everyone laughs. The woman curses loudly and puckers her thick, dark lips but the conductor ignores her.
There is something familiar about the way he speaks. It is when his shirt peeps through the gash on his grimy jacket that I notice that he is wearing the sport uniform from Tongogara. It is Tanaka. He was Isaac’s best friend. I cast my glance down, praying that he doesn’t recognize me. The kombi starts, earnestly this time, and exhaust fumes filter into the backseat from a leak on the floor. This time more passengers complain and try to open the windows. The touts outside, hired by Tanaka and his driver, stop them, wrestling them and forcefully shutting the windows from the other side.
“Vabereki, don’t you know the police? Do you want to put this entire operation into disrepute? Ehii! You will open the windows when we leave the danger zone”, Tanaka says, licking his fingers as he counts the money and hands out the tickets to the passengers. Sometimes the police throw teargas through open kombi windows, especially if the conductors don’t bribe them. As soon as we leave the station, Tanaka signals that it is safe to open the windows. The passengers are placated, and I am relieved when he turns his head to look forward. His neck is darker, and his voice is a little hoarse, and I reckon it must be from all the shouting and hanging from the kombi door. He would have been in his first year at university. The rest of the journey continues in silence, punctuated by the few people calling out their bus stops.
“Left turn, right turn, pamusika- by the market, pacorner – around the corner, before the shops, after junction”, they say in succession as they leave, making room for more people to get in. Someone even says, “before the big pothole” and everyone laughs. It is a beautiful and sad sort of laughter, the laughter Baba gave when he discovered that Isaac was not his son, Mainini Elizabeth’s laughter when she saw Baba hanging from the Musasa tree, after Babamunini Jacob left us and ran away with Amai and Isaac, a laughter born from despair too great to produce tears. I look out the window when we arrive at the station, and I see a woman huddling over a fruit stall. Isaac and I used to buy from her all the time, on our way to school.  She is still selling the bulbous oranges, and speckled banana clumps but beside her is a smaller replica of her, obviously her daughter, and she is roasting maize cobs on a lifted metal grill. They are chatting excitedly, beating their palms together at intervals as they laugh, the signs of gossip in progress. I leave them behind as I make my way out of the station. There is little tarred road left on the streets. There are only thin strips. The rubbish bins are overflowing but the little boys playing football and the little girls skipping rope hardly notice. They jump over the rubbish and pick some of it out of the road with their hands and cast them aside before resuming play. Just before I turn onto Hamilton Street, I must jump over a stream of sewer water flowing from the house on the corner. Someone has placed bricks in the greenish water to form a little bridge. I step on them gingerly, careful not to spoil my shoes. I almost run down the street, excitement building up as I get nearer to the mail. When I knock on the gate, Ma’ Ruva, the new tenant, opens it. She smiles and hugs me.
“Look at you, a big man now. Is that a beard? Soon we'll be coming to your wedding,” she says, opening the gate wider so I can fit in. It creaks and I make a mental note to bring some grease the next time I come. The house looks too new and out of place in this neighborhood. The pavement once overgrown with weeds is now a clean cobble path. Petunias and marigolds now stand where Amai’s rose patch used to be and the dark streaks on the walls have disappeared under a coat of fresh cream paint. Mainini Elizabeth renovated the house soon after the funeral and leased it. A child, undoubtedly Ma’ Ruva’s grandchild, has scrawled an obscene word underneath one of the windowsills with charcoal but I pretend not to notice. I will tell Mainini about it later. Ma’ Ruva makes a show of picking up a broom to sweep the Musasa leaves scattered around the yard, but she soon tires of the act and stops. They were here when I came last month anyway, and they too have become a permanent feature on the house like the baby napkins that are always on the drying line. Ruva, her daughter and the conjurer of napkins, walks up the driveway, her hand behind her back. She is heavily pregnant again. She spits before she greets me, a thick, yellow globule of saliva that makes a slap sound as it hits the pavement.
“Is that you, Ishie? The boy from the ‘dale dales!’. Ende you are a real man now. Life in Borrowdale suits you, and that mother of yours must be taking good care of you.” she says, spitting again and running her hand over her lips to remove the spittle. I notice that there still is no wedding band on it. She rubs the hand on the green maternity dress and sighs as if she has said a lot. She looks tired, sweat is flowing from her old, disheveled weave onto her face, and it has left dark, moist patches under her armpits. It is hard to believe that we are the same age. A toddler begins crying in from the veranda where a crib lies, and she limps back to it. Another child is playing with a deflated ball next to the Musasa tree. I turn to the letterbox and unlock it. I lock it and keep the keys because I am sure Ma’ Ruva and Ruva herself would open my letters if I did not. I hand them the water bill and put the envelopes in my pocket. Curiosity gets the best of me, and I take them out. It is like every other month; a letter from Isaac, a letter from Babamunini Jacob and no letter from Amai. I open Isaac’s first. There are two letters, one in his neat handwriting that has not changed even when he moved to London with Babamunini and Amai, and the other, a copy of an admissions letter from Oxford. He has been admitted into the law school as expected. There are some photographs in the letter. I take out one of Amai, Babamunini Jacob, and Isaac in front of their home. Amai is fatter, and her face is now free from the little lines of worry that were on the corners of her eyes and mouth. Her face does not look like it has swelled or seen a black eye in years. I lift the photograph to stare at it closely. Amai is pregnant. I can see the small bulge in her stomach that her hands are wrapped around protectively. I wish I could hold Amai’s hands again, to listen to the stories they tell now. Ma’ Ruva leans forward, standing on her toes to peer over my shoulder. If I raise my shoulders a little, I will be able to block her view, but I let her see.
“She looks good. Going abroad looks so good on her. Your Babamunini is doing a great job. Ruva come see,” she says motioning to Ruva with her hand. Ruva tries to stand up from her chair, her face grimacing and she gives up and throws her hands in the air. “You will tell me about it mother,” she says as she crashes into the seat. The sweat on her face is beginning to wash away her makeup, leaving brown streaks on her cheeks and staining the shoulders of her dress.
Ma’ Ruva, like everyone else, does not know what happened. Officially, Amai is one of the lucky nurses who get jobs in London and relocate. “How fortunate after that terrible accident”, they say when they talk about it after Mass, at the salon and in their houses. People never commit suicide here, they have accidents. Babamunini Jacob went to London too, to help Amai and Isaac settle down. I have not yet gone, because I have to finish school and my visa was not approved, so I have had to move with Mainini Elizabeth. That is as far as everyone knows, because the people here cannot afford to visit Mainini Elizabeth and I, to see that Babamunini Jacob has not been back in three years.
I do not open Babamunini Jacob’s letter. I already know what is in the envelope; a thick wad of pounds, stuffed between the curt letter telling me to study hard for my O level examinations, to use the money wisely and lastly to write back. Mainini Elizabeth does not know about the mail.
“Ishie, tell your mother that rent money will be paid next week. We are just waiting for all the money to be converted into forex. No one wants these bearer cheques anymore.”
Ma’ Ruva shakes her head as she speaks, the graying ends of her dreadlocks bouncing up and down.
“Who knew that we would all be millionaires and billionaires in this Zimbabwe?” she says laughing at no one and everyone. I smile and nod, walking toward the Musasa tree. It is towering over the house now, in a large umbrella shape. The scars where the men tried, and failed, to ax it down after the accident are already fading. I pick up a handful of its flowers and put a little inside Isaac’s envelope. I carry their scent as I walk up Hamilton Street and jump over the sewer water which seems less pungent now and pass the little children, making way for the refuse trucks to collect the rubbish. I do not hear them taunting the madhodhabhini, men who infrequently collect the bins from house to house or their cries of “ndege, ndege – aeroplane, aeroplane” as a low flying jet thunders across the skies. I run my hands over the letters in my pocket instead. I will carefully hold the pictures and stare at them until I know every small detail on them, and the details weave themselves into my dreams and stories. Maybe afterwards, I will stick them on the wall of my room at St. Georges, and I will read and reread the letters; until they are brown with fingerprints, until they lose the sickly-sweet smell of  Musasa flowers, until next month, when the postman will dutifully deliver the new letters.

        "
        	The atmosphere was different the moment Hugo stepped into the lobby with its muted-white walls and weak light, but truth be told, he had been far too tired to register it at that moment. Simply walking up the stairs to the fifth floor of the Hoskins Department of Mathematical Sciences was rigorous enough to mandate all of his limited mental focus. Once he entered the hallway, however, Hugo began to sense that something had changed. Had something happened here? He looked down the hallway, then into a few classrooms. Everything seemed normal. Students in class there, empty classroom there. Yet the floor was notably tense, as if some solemn event were about to happen. Maybe there was an announcement he didn’t bother to read. Hugo checked his email and phone every morning, but perhaps his exhaustion made him skip over a line or two. Upon reaching Professor Kramer’s door at the end of the hall, he tapped his knuckles gently once, twice, three, four times. Did he usually tap four times? Perhaps five. Occasionally six, but the average was definitely somewhere between four and five. And it was normally distributed, no doubt.
        	A moment passed, then another. A few more seconds. She was in her office, no? When he spoke to her about his progress on his dissertation—he had finished establishing the necessary theory behind algebraic varieties and was starting to work on their applications to number theory—she was in her office, and seemed content speaking to him. He said that he expected to complete the next chapter within a few weeks, and definitely by the end of November. Hugo was glad he had given her a longer timespan to complete that chapter. It had been two weeks since he said that, and his progress had been less than reassuring. He prayed that there was some meaningful way to analyze numbers and find something new about how to factor them, because no other route proved to be successful so far. He had sunk four precious years into a PhD program, and he refused to take nothing from it.
        	Still no response. Hugo knocked again, once, twice, three, four, five times. Surely five was pushing the bounds of what was considered socially acceptable. He examined the light brown door, textured with creases that ran from top to bottom. Office doors in the math department had no windows, although classroom doors did. Was there any rhyme or reason behind which doors had windows?
Nothing from inside. She wasn’t in. Someone else might be relieved to have more time to work on their dissertation before reporting to their advisor, but Hugo found the inconvenience annoying. Even if he had absolutely nothing, he would readily report as such to Professor Kramer. She would understand. He turned around and knocked on Professor Donner’s door. It then occurred to him that maybe Donner was lecturing. But no. Donner opened the door.
        	“Yes? Oh, Hugo. What is it?”
        	“Hi, Professor. I, uh, planned to speak with Professor Kramer today. She’s my advisor for my PhD. But I knocked on her door and she doesn’t seem to be in. Do you…might you know if she’ll be back soon, or, if she’s doing something else?”
        	It wasn’t until after Hugo finished getting those words out did he notice that Donner looked bewildered, as if he saw a magician’s disappearing act. Donner was frozen for a moment, looking far beyond Hugo, and then he dipped his head. Was he dizzy, or unwell? Donner’s mouth moved, but words failed to come out. On his second attempt, his voice emerged.
        	“Hugo, there’s quite a lot going on right now. But, uh, Alyssa isn’t coming in today. In fact, she may not be here…well, come in.” Donner almost seemed disappointed in having to bring Hugo into his office. What did he miss? Did he really miss a critical email? No, - glossing over emails would not drive Donner to hang his head like that. As he walked into a room hosting a storm of scattered books on countless mathematical topics, he began to wonder what could reduce Donner’s devilishly easy goingeasygoing demeanor into such a sullen shell.

        	Hugo sat in the student chair, with Donner opposite him. The exhaustion in his eyes and blankness in his mouth’s expression seemed only to confirm the worst about Kramer. What had happened? An accident? Something far more tragic? Or far more sinister?
        	“Well, see, I only heard about it earlier this morning. Martha sent us all an email before eight in the morning, punctual as usual. So I guess the faculty know, but they chose not to tell the students yet. Not that we’ll really get a say in that. Admin will decide who does and doesn’t know.” Donner’s eyes stole a glimpse at his monitor. Hugo could only guess he was anxious for updates on whatever catastrophe could have befallen Kramer.
        	“I wouldn’t tell most students, but you’ve been around since, what, your first undergraduate year? That’s just so long ago…and now this is what, your fourth year in a PhD program…anyway, just make sure to tell no one of this.”
        	Hugo nodded. He had been trusted with many a secret over the years, but only from siblings, cousins, and friends. He didn’t expect his parents or other relatives above his generation to confide in him, so having a university professor entrust a secret to him was entirely unprecedented. In a lighter context, he would be proud. Now, he could only acknowledge that whatever he was about to know was completely out of his hands.
        	“Yeah, as I said, normally, professors telling students about stuff like this is a massive no-no. This could end my career. But I trust you to keep this under wraps. So…it turns out that, last night, Alyssa found that…one of her sons had died. In the house. But the other son was fine. Perfectly healthy. She was…well, she called 911, of course. She also called Veblen, and her husband. I think she gave Veblen the go-ahead to tell the rest of the department…who knows if I would’ve done that in her shoes.”

        	No, Hugo had never met any of Kramer’s sons, despite knowing her for seven years. He did meet her husband, Jens, though. In his senior undergraduate year, he and a group of math majors took Kramer out to dinner, and Jens came along. Whenever Kramer wasn’t preparing her next complex analysis lecture or advising a thesis student, she would help Jens take care of their son Lonnie, and later, their newborn Peter. Jens never went a moment that night without talking about his sons’ latest adventures through the house without a broad smile and energetic laugh. Kramer herself was all too eager to say that Peter might one day be as successful as Hugo and the other students, young, capable, and eager. When they parted ways after finishing dinner, Hugo saw a family shining brighter than what any sitcom could depict. Surely it was only up for them, especially Alyssa Kramer. A decorated professor at a prestigious university with an up-and-coming family in tow. That one of her sons would suddenly die was incomprehensible.
        	“I don’t really know much more than that, honestly. It happened last night, so I don’t think more than twelve hours have passed. Of course, Alyssa won’t be coming in for a while, and maybe not at all. God knows what she’s going through right now. I don’t have kids yet, but the prospect of something like this happening to anyone is…” Donner’s voice trailed off as he looked down, tracing a circle on his desk with his left index finger.
        	“Surely…surely the school will give her leave. Paid leave. If they ignore something like this, they’re gonna catch hell for it.” Hugo knew that financial issues were a negligible concern in such a horrific situation, but he could find nothing else to say. Alyssa Kramer’s son is dead? He had a hard time coming to terms with it, and yet Kramer herself must be unimaginably devastated.
        	“I haven’t really thought about the finances, Hugo.” Donner didn’t look up. “We’re all looking out for her. I’m sure she has relatives to help her get through this. But of course, we can only imagine what she’s going through. If it helps, reach out to her. I’m sure she’d appreciate it. But, uh, not yet. Maybe let a few days pass. We’re still learning about what happened.”
        	“Right. Of course.” Hugo had no idea what he should say. To a mother who lost her son? And his own advisor, no less? He would need at least the rest of the day to process this. As he bid Donner a good day, his mind went back to Kramer’s smile during that dinner. It was just as happy as that of Jens. Or was it? When he focused on that memory, that smile seemed to have some force, however imperceptible, pulling it down.

        	The rest of the day, as well as the day after, passed like a thin wind. Hugo lectured students. One lecture in the morning, one in the afternoon, two the following afternoon. He continued to add one variable at a time to his dissertation, avoiding any task that would require actual mental exertion. For Eevery time he focused on math, he would think of Kramer, and he would dwell on exactly what to say to her. He very well couldn’t simply go on as if nothing had happened, and that was assuming she would return to her job. Stray thoughts continued to ricochet in his mind, bouncing off every corner of his skull. When he tried to catch one and determine exactly what it was, though, it always just barely slipped out of his mental grasp. There was plenty of worry trailing those thoughts, though. Worry not only for Kramer, but also about the actual death. What had happened? How come one son died and the other was fine? What kind of accident would lead to such a chillingly random outcome?
        	By the end of Friday, Hugo had a first draft of what to write or say to Kramer in his head. Something about how he understood she was going through more than he could ever imagine, and probably some sort of reassurance that he still wanted to work with her in the future. Would he ever get to say it? Perhaps she would never return to the university, or worse. He decided that if she didn’t come back in another month, he would email her. After speaking to Donner or Young about it, maybe both of them.
        	As he struggled to file away his lecture notes in a folder overflowing with paper and tearing apart at its center, Hugo checked the clock at the far end of the lecture hall. It said 5:07, but that clock is  was always slightly late, so it was likely around 5:10. Donner and Young were probably heading home, or packing up. Hugo decided to let them go home for the week and ask them about what to say on Monday. He examined the folder to ensure that it would not rip in half and spill nearly 200 sheets of paper all across the floor, then began to ease it into his backpack.
        	“Excuse me. Are you Hugo Barr?”
        	A man in a worn gray suit andwith a maroon tie glanced across the lecture hall as he took a few cautious steps in. Upon seeing nobody else, he turned back to Hugo. His gaze was disinterested, and his hands stayed firmly inside his pockets, but if he had walked a single step closer, Hugo may have taken a step back.
        	“Who…um…who are you?” Hugo knew all the janitors at Hoskins, and none of them wore a white buttoned shirt, let alone a suit and tie. And no professor would speak to a lecture assistant on a Friday evening. So who was this?
“Detective Lorenzo D. Kissinger. I was hoping we could chat for a few minutes. I know you’re all too eager to head home, but I’d love to get this done before the weekend, and I hope you can accommodate me.” He produced a black badge from his breast pocket and showed its face to Hugo, but did not extend his arm, instead keeping his elbow tucked against his side. His gaze hardened, then reverted to its original form. Watching him.
        	“Uh, sure. Should we head to the common room?” Hugo had no idea if this man was really a detective, so being alone anywhere with him was a frightening prospect. At least Cliff or another janitor who might be on shift would be able to see him in the common room.
        	“I’d be happy too. Show me the way.” The detective pocketed his badge and stepped to the side. Hugo picked up his backpack and walked past him. Every step from the lecture hall to the fifth-floor common room brought his gaze further and further down until he was staring at the tiles his feet passed with each step. The man maintained a strict distance of three paces, his feet silently landing on and lifting from the floor at the same time his did.

        	“So, to begin. My name is Lorenzo D. Kissinger. I’m a detective at the Barrett County Police Department, and I’ve been there for nearly nine years now. I received a report of a tragic incident yesterday, just after noon. When I arrived, I examined the scene and decided to carry the investigation further. One of the primary persons of interest is affiliated with the Hoskins Department of Mathematical Sciences, so I arrived here this morning and spoke with Professors Veblen Young and Paul Donner. The latter directed me to you, and besides, everyone else was occupied for the day. I’d like to ask you about Professor Alyssa Kramer.”
        	A tragic incident? Examining a scene? Why wais he here? If Hugo’s mind had wayward thoughts bouncing around at the speed of hockey pucks before, they were now moving at the speed of sound. What was Kissinger describing? Hugo stared at the man’s gray coat, covered in lint, and he realized he had his mouth open.
        	“I know there’s a lot going on, but you don’t need to worry about too much right now. Normally, I refrain from giving people so much information upfront, but Donner said you know Kramer quite well and can be trusted to keep secrets. I wouldn’t want to keep you guessing, so once you help me, I’ll help you.
        	After moving soundlessly for several seconds, Hugo finally managed to form words. “Well…Professor Kramer works here at Hoskins. She’s been doing so for about ten years now. She’s my advisor for my dissertation, since I’m a PhD student and working on algebraic number theory. That’s her field of specialization. She also lectures undergraduate students on math courses…typically the ones required for an undergraduate major. And, uh…she’s very kind…cares about everyone, has a genuine desire to see her students excel. I, uh…do you want to know anything specific? But I don’t really have all the answers.”
        	Kissinger kept his eyes on Hugo for barely a moment, then spoke again. “Okay, then. How many times a week did you meet her?”
        	“We meet once every two weeks on Thursday morning. So yesterday, I went to see her, but she wasn’t around.” Hugo decided not to divulge what Donner had told him just yet. Surely Kissinger knew what had happened, but if he gave away such crucial information so quickly, it might derail the current line of questioning, and Hugo felt safe answering these easy questions. Besides, Donner would probably face consequences if it came out that he told Hugo about the incident.
        	“Just once every two weeks? You’re a PhD student, not an undergrad, and she’s your advisor. Surely it’d make sense to meet more often. Does she have any other students in a PhD or master’s program?”
        	“No, just me right now. Her other PhD student left two years ago.”
        	“Hmm. And how is she as an advisor, when you do meet?”
        	“Very enthusiastic about the subject. Seems to want me to do well, almost as if I’m destined to be the next Andrew Wiles.”
        	“Does she usually arrive late to work? Or leave early? Has she ever seemed distracted, or uninterested?”
        	“No, she always…” Hugo dropped his line. Kramer was almost always punctual and willing to stay after hours to help him sort out issues with his homework, and later his dissertation, but now that Kissinger mentioned it, she did seem to stare off beyond the walls of her office more frequently in the past month. She was just thinking about her own research, right? But something about her eyes seemed to suggest something else. Something not related to math at all. It was as if she were silently speaking to herself as he presented his progress on his dissertation. Maybe even debating herself. On what?
        	“Hmm. Well, what’s she like when she isn’t focused? Does she seem upset, or angry, or unhappy?”
        	“Not angry, no. A bit…searching. Like she’s searching for something, like a wanderer. Maybe a bit unhappy, I guess.”
        	“Do you know what might be causing this? Maybe you might know a bit about her personal life. I don’t expect you to know, of course, but maybe you know something.”
        	“Honestly, it baffles me. I met her husband, and they both were so happy. It was a shining example of the American dream. Well off, neighborly, two kids. I…” Hugo felt something catch his voice from beneath. Not anymore. One of her sons was dead. Whatever bright future the family had was shattered.

    <string name="wencheS2">"
        “Can you tell me a bit more about, say, what she was like in early October? Before yesterday?”
        	“I mean, she was distracted, but not hostile or anything. What’s going on, Detective? Is Professor Kramer in…” Hugo had trouble exhaling at that moment. Trouble? Of course she was in some sort of trouble. Why on earth would a police detective be involved. But why was she under investigation? Was there another aspect to her son’s death? Some type of crime committed at the same place, or the same time? What was unfolding behind the scenes?
        	“Don’t worry about Professor Kramer. I assure you she’s fine. I just want to know about what she was like at work, and if her personal life bled into it at any point.”
        	“No. No, it didn’t. I don’t know what you want me to say. What’s going on? Look, I can’t help you if you don’t tell me what you want to know. I’ve said all I can about Professor Kramer.”
        	Kissinger’s eyebrows dropped—by a barely perceptible margin, but they dropped. His eyes began to force a path into Hugo’s head, prying his skull open to find the answers he wanted. “You haven’t been very helpful, Mr. Barr. Keep in mind if you don’t tell me more, I’ll have to come back and speak to you again. Is there anything of note about Professor Kramer you think you should tell me?”
        	Hugo took a breath in. “Please…please just tell me what’s going on. If I know exactly what you want to know, then I can help you. I just hope…I just hope things go well for Kramer.”
        	Kissinger retracted his gaze and leaned back. He pondered his next move. Hugo realized he had one more card to play.
        	“Detective, you said you didn’t want to keep any secrets. If you help me, I’ll help you. Please, tell me what’s going on.”
        	The detective pressed his fingers together, forming a web that oscillated between open and closed as he twitched the tendons in his hands. He looked to the side, as if to confirm that nobody else was around, then faced Hugo.
        	“Alright. Fine. I told Professor Young all about it. He was ultimately unable to round out my investigation, so I hope you have the answers. I need not tell you to inform absolutely nobody about this. Understand?”
        	Hugo nodded.
“Okay. So two days ago, on the night of Wednesday, October 14, emergency services received a call from a residential address that belonged to Jens and Alyssa Kramer. They were told that something catastrophic happened: a young child had been found in the bathtub, not moving. Two paramedics arrived at the address within minutes, and they found the caller: Professor Alyssa Kramer. They were directed to the bathroom, and found the child removed from the bathtub. Despite several concerted attempts to revive the child, the child was pronounced dead at the scene. Kramer watched on, and stayed by another child throughout the incident, who was not harmed. Her husband, Jens Kramer, was at a conference and did not return home until 10 PM, one hour after the call came in.”
        	Kissinger paused. Hugo waited for what would come next. There had to be some other facet of the incident, right? The crime that he hadn’t mentioned. But something told Hugo that wasn’t the case.
        	“Professor Kramer claimed that she had found her older son, Lonnie Kramer, still in the bathtub when she checked on him. She removed him and immediately called emergency services. However, there is reason to believe her version of events is not entirely true.”
        	Once again, Hugo was bewildered. What was going on?
        	“Emergency services took Lonnie Kramer’s body to Clearview Hospital at around 10:30 PM. Jens went with them, whereas Alyssa preferred to watch over her other son, Peter Kramer. Upon examining the body, the paramedics noticed a series of faint bruises along the torso, and several fingernails were scratched or chipped. They thought these injuries to be suspicious and called a coroner over, who performed a more detailed analysis. At 6:00 AM on Thursday, October 15, the coroner determined that there was a distinct possibility that Lonnie Kramer’s drowning and death was not completely natural. In other words, someone drowned him.”
        	Hugo had yet to internalize the torrent of information given to him, prompting Kissinger to continue, his face keeping its blank, neutral form.
        	“Clearview Hospital then called Barrett County, and they sent me over. At the hospital, I examined the body and largely agreed with the coroner. After speaking to Jens Kramer, I went to the house and spoke to Alyssa Kramer. Then I went here and spoke to Young and Donner. Now, I’m speaking to you. Do you understand what’s going on now?”
        	It couldn’t be, could it? Was this man really accusing Kramer of…?
        	“I want to know if anything you observed about Professor Kramer might indicate that she was mentally unwell, disturbed, or if there was any sort of behavior that might suggest she had the capability or impetus of committing some sort of crime. Now, what do you know?”
        	It was after 5 PM on a Friday. Hugo had been brain-dead exhausted since Monday morning, and his sleep debt had only compounded over the week, leaving him scrambling to piece together the information given to him to form a coherent picture. But one thing was certain: This man was accusing Kramer of a crime. A crime she almost certainly didn’t commit. How could he? Accuse Professor Kramer, of all people? Was he even sane?
        	“What the…what are you implying? Are you saying Professor Kramer is a criminal? What’s going on? I assure you, she was an endlessly kind person. And she had everything going for her. Are you saying…”
        	“Tell me, Hugo. Any sign of something wrong with Kramer? Did she say anything, maybe about her sons? Or maybe about a problem? Something that, perhaps, she wanted to deal with?”
        	“This…this is insane. It’s insane! You’re saying that Kramer had to find her dead son, having drowned, and you’re saying…this…that…”
        	“Focus! Hugo, I want an answer. What did she say?”
        	“She didn’t say anything! She loved both her sons. Her family was so well off. You cannot tell me that she would murder her own son!”
        	“Are you prepared to make a formal statement on that? I don’t appreciate liars, you know. If I find that you haven’t been truthful to me, it won’t end well for you.”
        	“What the fuck is wrong with you? Professor Kramer has just lost her son, and you want to charge her with murder? Can you imagine what she’s going through? You’re fucking sick! Who the hell do you think you are? I thought you as a detective would hunt down criminals and keep innocent people safe! Not ruin the lives of people who have just had the unthinkable happen to them! You sick, sick, fucking bastard! Rot in hell!”
        	As Hugo took one deep breath after another, he realized he had risen to his full height. His arms were at chest level, having gestured furiously through the air. Kissinger’s hair was nearly two feet below his eye level. He had not moved from his previous position, leaning forward and staring at Hugo’s torso. Once again, that blank expression. Even now, after he had played his hand, Hugo felt that there was still something the detective was keeping him in the dark about.
        	“Sit down. I’ve more to tell you.”
        	“And why should I—”
        	“Sit down!”
        	Hugo lowered himself into the green, speckled couch. He rested his elbows on the armrests. Kissinger’s stare was now colored with a fierce authority that drew him to wait for what he had to say next.
        	“The coroner discovered a distinct possibility that Lonnie Kramer had been held down for several minutes in the bathtub. Now, if that is the case, then who could’ve done it? Keep in mind Jens Kramer did not come home until 10 PM, one hour after Alyssa Kramer called 911.”
        	“No. No, you’re wrong. The coroner must be mistaken. You said a possibility. Not a certainty.”
        	“I have more evidence. I would tell you, but clearly you’re not fit to know. I’ve been a detective for nine years, Mr. Barr. I’ve seen a lot. So don’t think to lecture me on how to do my job.”
        	The man lifted himself from the couch. “I’ll be going now. Take care of yourself. Else you find yourself undergoing a psychological evaluation not unlike the one Kramer will have to go through.”
        	The man strode off from the common room and vanished into the stairwell. Hugo kept his gaze on the spot he disappeared from for nearly a full minute after he left.

        	Professor Veblen Young was occupied for the entirety of Monday morning. Hugo finally managed to arrange a meeting with him at 3 PM, between two lectures. Throughout the weekend, as he kept constant tabs on his email as he searched for the soonest possible moment to speak with Young, Hugo’s mind did not stray from what the detective said. Was he really right, in a sense? Surely he wouldn’t make such an accusation without good reason. But to imagine the actual act, of Alyssa Kramer holding her son beneath the water—Hugo swept the papers off his desk. Horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible! He roared towards the ceiling, slammed his fist down on the desk, what a horrible, horrible thought! No. No, it couldn’t be true. Surely Young would agree. He could convince the man that Kramer was innocent, even though he had evaporated all credibility with his outburst on Friday.
Hugo didn’t even knock—he just opened the door wide open with the momentum of his body. Monday was the first day of the week, so he only had one day of sleep debt to grapple with. Professor Young turned from his monitor, surprised at Hugo’s blunt entrance.
        	“Please, tell me what you know.” Hugo sat down in the red cafeteria chair positioned at Young’s immaculate desk. “Sorry. Uh, I’m Hugo, introduced myself over email. So Donner told me about what happened to Kramer, and I found out that Detective Kissinger spoke to you. I mean, I told you almost everything over email. What did Kissinger say to you?”
        	Young sighed. Hugo conceded that very few people were moving at his mental speed, especially on a Monday. “Kissinger spoke to me at around 10 AM on Friday. He said it was important and asked that I pause my work. He informed me that he believes the death of Lonnie Kramer was not an unfortunate incident—it was caused intentionally. Specifically, Alyssa is responsible for Lonnie’s death. There was quite a bit of evidence, as well as other information to support his case. It looks like I’m the primary contact between the department and the police, so he told me much of what he knows. Listen, I want to make sure that everything’s okay. I heard from Paul that Alyssa was your PhD advisor, so if she doesn’t come back, do you have a plan?”
        	“Ah, uh…” Hugo realized that his dissertation had made zero progress since Thursday. Surely the death of Kramer’s son was far more important, right? But Young had a point—if he didn’t complete his first draft by the end of November, his graduation would be in jeopardy, and the mere thought of redoing the past four years charged him with a bolt of anxiety that directed him to his work. “Well, if all else fails, I can just complete it without an advisor. I mean, maybe I can read previous students’ theses. I know that two years ago, Serena Li completed her thesis on a very similar topic, and she did remarkably well. Or maybe I can find an advisor somewhere else.” It soon became apparent that Hugo was indeed in trouble—there were very few faculty members that could advise a thesis on such a specific topic.
        	Young sighed. “Look, Hugo, this is hard for us all. Yes, what happens to Kramer is the most important, but we can’t neglect our daily lives. Take some time to think about how you’ll finish your PhD. I personally wouldn’t mind being your advisor, since there is some overlap between my research interests and hers. Tell me, did Kissinger speak to you?”
        	“Yeah. He, uh, told me about what he thought of Kramer.” Hugo decided to omit his outburst from his account. He told himself that it wasn’t important for Young to know, but the truth was that it was quite an embarrassing episode, and it would look good if Young found out that he lost his temper on a first impression. When it was time to wrap up his side of the story, he made sure to emphasize Kissinger’s remark that he had more evidence. “Do you know anything about that?”
        	Young turned back to his monitor, making a few clicks and seemingly organizing files. Not even a sigh—what was he thinking? Young rubbed his temple with the palm of his left hand, twitching the cursor on the computer screen with his right. “Ah, well, if the good detective told me, I might as well tell you. You see, the administration recently announced that Alyssa suddenly became quite ill and won’t be coming in for some time. Of course, you and I know what really happened, but can you imagine how the student body would react if they knew? God knows what kind of trouble would emerge—some people just can’t be satisfied with leaving things be. But I digress. You asked about evidence about Kramer? There were the marks on the body, for one. Also, her papers. Kramer told emergency services and the detective that she had fallen asleep on the couch working on her research. That was about twenty minutes before she found her son in the bathtub. I believe the child was at the age where he generally could be left alone in the tub. So after filling it with water, Kramer put her son in and continued to think about her research. She took her papers to the couch so she could rest her head somewhere, and ended up falling asleep. But the detective didn’t find her papers anywhere near the couch. They were neatly ordered in her folder on her desk. The detective reasoned that if she really woke up and realized her son had been in the bathtub unattended for twenty minutes, she wouldn’t have bothered to put away her papers before checking on him.”
        	“But surely there’s another explanation for that. Maybe she put her papers away while emergency services took the body to the hospital.”
        	“Yes, maybe that’s true. I hope it is, but there’s more. The couch itself wasn’t indented at all—especially not on the armrest, where she would’ve been laying her head. It was as if nobody had touched it for a full day. Completely undisturbed. And the forensics officer at the scene also doubted that Kramer had been lying down on the couch on the night of the incident. Not exactly definitive evidence, but it is quite concerning.”
        	“Okay, so then what? Are they gonna arrest her? Have they already done so?”
        	“No, I don’t think so, at least not yet. But I’m sure the detective is going to continue to build his case. And it’s not like we can stop him, right? The police will make a judgement, and we will have to make do. If she comes back, that’s great. If not, we hire another professor. I’m sure there are plenty of eager candidates to take an open position here at Hoskins.”
        	“But we have to do something! Look, surely we can convince Kissinger that Kramer’s innocent. I mean, maybe we can get students to speak out in her favor. I get that they don’t know yet, but if worse comes to worst, it is an option.”
        	“Hugo, be realistic. Nobody in this damn school’s gonna do that. Do you really think students are gonna take time out of their day to make a formal statement to the police? They might say no simply because it would involve the police. We can’t rely on the student body. And the faculty have their hands tied as well, at least for the moment. Admin is guiding our every action, and Paul took a huge risk by telling you what happened. I’d love to help, but there’s not much we can do.”
        	“Look, if it means the difference between Kramer going to jail or going free and being able to continue teaching here, there’d have to be a few students who’d speak up for her, right? She’s easily one of the best professors in the department, there’d be people who remember her. I’m sure they’d remember her kindness, her desire to see everyone succeed. This is about justice, but also about keeping the community together. Not to mention some of the more selfish students might just want fifteen minutes in the spotlight.”
        	Young sighed. “Listen, Hugo, do you really expect students to step up to the plate? They might defend Dawson or Garber, but nobody really cares about Kramer. You and Serena are the only ones to really care about her in the past five or six years. Most people don’t, and not without reason. Several students have said in their evaluations that she would often ignore struggling or average students and instead fixate on the stars of each class. Which I suppose includes you. Now, granted, those were just students, they may have lied a little or maybe were mistaken. But you have to understand that your perception of her isn’t the be all, end all. Surely even you’ve noticed that in recent days, she’s been distracted, even dismissive of students.”
        	Hugo leaned back, put his hands together, and looked down. He forced himself to look back on the his years as a student and advisee. Yes, she cared. But she cared about everybody, right? Or did he ignore her flaws? He had to admit that he couldn’t precisely remember how willing she really was to help the students who had fallen behind each semester.
        	“I mean…maybe. I…”
        	“Hugo, don’t get me wrong. I hope she’s innocent, and your loyalty is quite respectable. But if the police want to charge her, I can’t do much. And sure, you can make a statement, but beyond that, you need to face that you can’t bend the world to your will.”
        	He tilted his head back. The ceiling was off-white, starting to chip in a few places here and there. The bookshelf to his left was just a few inches shy of the ceiling.
        	“I can’t really say anything else about the issue, at least not right now. You seem pretty upset about this, and I can’t blame you. Get some rest tonight. I suppose with your advisor out of the picture for now, you don’t really have much pressure to complete your dissertation. If I were you, I’d take advantage of that.”

        	It looked like midterm season was finally over by Tuesday. The students walking into class seemed less stressed, less tired. If he had to guess, Hugo probably looked that way as well. After meeting with Young, he decided not to think about the issue for the next few days. Spending too much time agonizing over it for the past five days had burned him out pretty severely. Forcing Kramer out of his mind, he turned to the class. They seemed eager to learn, right? Or maybe just happy to be one step closer in getting their degree. Many of them had lowered their heads and were staring down at the desks. They were cleaned pretty regularly, so at least the place was clean. He checked the clock. Prime time to start, no? He reviewed what had been taught the previous week, looked down at his notes, and began the lecture.

        	Wednesday was also a day not to think about the incident. Focus on lecture. Answer questions. Work on that annoying theorem, the one that had been holding back his dissertation for weeks now. To his surprise, Hugo found the transition back to his daily routine not only easy, but also pleasant. After the stress of the previous six days, his ordinary previous struggles were a welcome return to normal life. Of course, being a PhD student for math was far from the ordinary person’s experience, primarily in that not many people suffer as much brain damage as him, but at least he could eat lunch without dwelling on an awful tragedy that had transformed into an equally awful injustice. Hugo stared at his salad. Those tomatoes really weren’t fresh. And the cheese tasted stale, too. He picked up another leaf with his fork, and decided to order from the local burger joint next week.
*
        	It was hard to believe the clock’s display of 10:37 PM, especially since it seemed like he only got back to his two-room apartment moments ago. That was 7 PM, if he remembered correctly. So how did more than three hours pass? Maybe he fell asleep sometime during that time interval. Although life had been returning to normal for the past two days, there was no doubt that he was still chronically tired. Ever since his second undergraduate year, Hugo had been operating on a baseline of being somewhat tired, and he had gotten so used to it he was pretty sure his “normal” would be the average person’s “tired”, and some people’s “exhausted”. Every now and then, he had the urge to brag about his chronic lack of sleep, especially since it would imply he was endlessly productive. But that wasn’t really true—many evenings would be spent reading or playing chess online, often into the late hours of the night and even past midnight. Only then would he buckle up and actually start the night’s work. No surprise, then, that lights out would usually be at 3 AM or perhaps even later. The weekends were no different—a PhD program mandated a seven-day week, with work beginning at 11 AM on Saturdays and Sundays, his wake-up time for the weekends, and ending at 2 AM or even later. Of course, Hugo took plenty of breaks throughout the day and night, but there were almost never any “easy nights” where he could relax for several hours at a time. It was work, relax, work, relax, work, relax, work, relax, work, sleep. One day blended into another. Saturday was Sunday. Tuesday was Wednesday. Thursday was Saturday. His undergraduate years did give him nights off where he could go out with friends, but a PhD program? Nope. Seven-day weeks. Day after day after day. The only reminders that time was indeed passing were when the air grew cold in the fall and when the sun grew warm in the spring.
Hugo redirected his attention to the computer screen in front of him. Keep writing. Equation after equation. Sentence after sentence. He was tempted to check the page count, but resisted the urge. He didn’t want to know.

        	Nobody likes Mondays. Many people hate Mondays. But when Hugo walked into the weak light of the Hoskins lobby, preparing himself for another day of lecturing and working, he had to admit to himself that he didn’t hate Mondays. They were just another day of the week. No worse than Thursdays, or Tuesdays, or any day. Most likely because of his lifestyle of working seven days a week, but even then, he never understood why people hated Mondays. The week has to start sometime, right? If everyone worked three-day weeks, nobody would like Wednesday. What if people worked four-day, alternating weeks? Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday? Then nobody would have to walk into work utterly exhausted, except maybe on Sundays. Every day carried with it the promise of imminent rest. That was the promise that Hugo hoped would one day come true. Hopefully one day his unrelenting work ethic would finally pay off.
He reached the fifth floor. How do people not go insane? They go to high school for four years, have to take summer courses or internships in the summer, then undergraduate for four years, more internships or research opportunities in the summer and winter, then a job or graduate school. When do people relax? What do people look forward to, if there existed no prospect for a vacation longer than one week? Surely there must be a significant portion of the population that went mad before—
        	“Hugo! Good, I thought you were operating on autopilot and even that turned off.”
        	“Oh. Ah, um, Professor Donner. How are you?”
        	“Chill as always. You look burnt out. Life treating you okay?”
        	“Yeah. I think things are getting better.”
        	“Mm-hmm. Things are getting better for most of us. But I finally learned something new about Kramer. Thought you should know, since I learned from Veblen that you’re quite invested.”
        	“Oh, really?” Hugo had to admit that he had left Kramer on the backburner over the past week. Now that Donner was bringing him news, he almost felt guilty for ignoring the issue. It had occurred to him that Young was at least partially right about Kramer—during the walk back to his apartment last Friday, as his mind drifted from one topic to another, he recalled a desperate student asking Kramer questions on an imminent midterm, with half-hearted comments and no clear answer being returned. It was surprising to see what memory could dredge up when not focused on any particular topic.
        	“Yeah. Quite a development.” Donner looked around and confirmed that the hallway was empty. Not surprising—9:30 AM was right in the middle of a lecture period. “They arrested her. Thursday evening. Just when Veblen and I thought they would give up. She’s been in police custody ever since. Who knows what’ll happen next.”
        	“Wait, what? What? They really did?” The hallway became much wider. The space between the walls and Hugo’s arms seemed to suddenly grow much bigger. And the elevator—impossibly far away now. “Why did they…why now?”
        	Donner shrugged and spread his wrists sideways. His sober expression seemed to reach upwards for the slimmest of moments. “They don’t tell me anything. I presume they found new evidence. I’ll try to find out from Veblen, but I haven’t had a chance to speak to him. He might know. But maybe they cut him out of the loop too. Man, don’t you love information bureaucracy?” His mouth tried to form a sheepish smile again, and succeeded.
        	“Well, I’ll try to look into it as well.” Hugo decided to go on his own. “I might speak to Professor Kramer herself—hadn’t had the chance to do so since the incident.” He could hardly believe what he was saying, but it made so much sense. All this time, and he hadn’t said a word to Kramer herself. It was almost an injustice on its own. Shouldn’t she get a chance to tell her side of the story?
        	“Oh, really? Well, they’re probably holding her at Barrett County Police Department. Who knows if they’ll let you see her. Good luck.” Donner began to turn, but then turned back. “Quite the spirit. I like it. Make sure to knock ‘em dead.”

        	Who knows what the student body knew at this point. Hugo supposed that to all the undergrads scattered along the rows of lecture tables, Kramer was still unwell and would eventually return. Assuming, of course, that they even cared. If he had to guess, about 40% of those students were either in one of her classes or used to be. If they knew the truth, then surely they would support a member of their faculty, right? But Young was right about Kramer’s dismissive attitude, and judging by the unfocused gazes and slanted postures of the students before him, Hugo began to realize that they couldn’t give a rat’s ass about anything that didn’t directly affect them. H. Five years ago, he would’ve been shocked at how callous he was being to his fellow students, but now, he began to wish that they would all fail the class. He began his lecture, intent on hiding his frustration and resentment, but traces of his anger slipped out with the theorems he presented and proofs he detailed. By the time he presented Clairaut’s theorem at the last ten minutes of class, he punctuated the second condition with an emphatic swear word and slammed the chalk against the blackboard, breaking it in two. The broken halves missed the bottom shelf and tumbled to the floor, where they rolled past his feet before shyly coming to a stop. Hugo stared at the first broken half, then at the blackboard’s shelf. He took a breath through his nose, then another. Picking up the first broken half, he finished the lecture without any further incident. He couldn’t care less about what the students thought of his outburst. When he left the lecture hall, he didn’t retrieve the second half of the chalk.

        	Thankfully, Tuesday was the only day of the week Hugo finished early. After forcing a ham-and-cheese sandwich down his gullet, he arrived at the bus stop that would take him to the police station. Up until now, he had never tried to bus away from Hoskins this early, so he had no idea when the bus would come. Most of the others waiting with him were older men and women, none younger than fifty. A woman with white, curly hair held her dog in her lap, while a man in a white shirt alternated between looking for the eventually-to-arrive bus and the sparrows nibbling at whatever crumbs of food were left at the base of the nearby tree. He looked up at the sky. Patches of light gray feebly tried to ward off the incoming rainstorm. If the rain failed to start before he arrived at the police station, it would almost certainly be in full force by the time he left.

        	Barrett County Police Station seemed to have two main entrances, one going into each building. Which building should he go through? The one on the left looked like a smaller structure, but they would house detainees in a smaller wing, and convicts in a larger wing, right? But that didn’t seem right, either. Maybe the smaller wing was just for storage and secondary functions. He picked the entrance to the right. If he was wrong, the front desk could just redirect him.
        	Once he approached the front desk and asked to see Professor Kramer, the receptionist dialed her phone with sleight-of-hand that would make a magician jealous and began speaking to whoever was presumably in charge of the detainee’s area. Not a formal warden, right? That was for convicts. He had to admit he had no idea how this works, but reassured himself by saying it was unimportant. He could speak to one of his friends about it when it was all over. It would end. One way or another.
        	The receptionist placed the phone down and directed him to the waiting room. Down the hall to the right, last left is the elevator. Go up to the third floor, take a left, take a right, straight down into the visitor’s room. A guard would notify him when Kramer would be available. With a curt nod and brief thanks, Hugo set out. He may not be able to prove number-theoretic assertions or make a convincing statement to a detective, but he could at least follow directions.

        	 When the elevator doors opened, Hugo tentatively stepped out into a split path with only two directions. He took a left, and the right followed immediately after. Then it was just step after step to the end of the hall. The hallway was lined with small windows meant to only accommodate one face at regular intervals. He couldn’t help himself—he peered into each one. Empty. Someone he didn’t know. Empty. Someone he did know. Wait a moment—that was Jens! Jens Kramer! Was he being interrogated? Were they putting the blame on him? Or maybe both him and Alyssa Kramer? His mind raced in full force as he approached the visitor’s room. The doorknob was five paces away, four, three. What if…? Two paces away. Maybe he could find something out. One pace away. Hugo hesitated. He looked backward—the hall was empty. He glanced back at the door. To hell with it. Jens’ window was the last one. As he approached it, step by step, hoping that nobody would turn the corner or leave the visitor’s room, Hugo examined the wall surrounding the window. To his delight, there was a crumbling, gaping hole in the wall below and to the left of it. He had already seen that the building was in dire need of renovations when he first approached it, but the level of interior damage was truly appalling. If Hoskins was this bad, he might not have done a PhD program. Jens was facing away from the visitor’s room, so his interrogator must be facing towards it. So it would make sense to cross the window once more and stand near the door, so the interrogator would have no chance of seeing him. Hugo took his position, drew his phone and pretended to wait for a text, and began to listen.
        	“Before you went with the paramedics, what did you do?”
        	“I was beside Lonnie the whole time. Just hoping, hoping that somehow, he’d wake up, start coughing, come back alive. Somehow, the water would expel itself from his lungs, he’d start breathing, crying, moving, something. I waited beside him. Waiting for him to be alive.”
        	“Did you notice anything else? Did you speak to your wife?”
        	“Not really, no. Before I left, I went to Alyssa. She was beside Peter the whole time. Cradling him, holding him. Next to the crib. Peter’s still young, you see—he’ll turn two in January. She was silent. Motionless. I asked if Peter was okay. She nodded, and whispered yes.”
        	“Did you say anything else?”
        	“I told her I was going with Lonnie to the hospital. She said okay. She said something under her breath…about our family. Something about how we’ll all be okay.”
        	“What did she mean by that?”
        	“I guess she was just trying to console me. And herself. But I can’t help but feel that she was being vague. I—normally, when she says something, I know the exact meaning. But not this time. For the first time in ten years, I can’t figure out what she’s thinking.”
        	“What do you think was on her mind? Do you think she was thinking about Lonnie? Or perhaps, the moment of his death?”
        	Jens sighed. “Hell if I know. But she was constantly looking down at Peter. And the room was dark—I just couldn’t make out her face. She didn’t say anything to him, but she was speaking to him. She always said she knew everything about Peter. So I guess she was, like, talking to him telepathically, if that makes sense. I—she loved Peter so much. She shared his pain, his laughter, every moment. Every weekend, she would hug him at least twice a day. Every passing moment when we were in the yard.”
        	“Okay, what about Lonnie? Did she love Lonnie as well?”
        	The air spoke. The dust spoke. Hugo imagined the interviewer in the room, watching Jens’ face move down, then to the side, searching for an answer. The dust continued to speak, dancing amongst the corners of the room. Light continued to pour out from the sides of the room. Heat continued to gather near the ceiling.
        	“I…I really…I think she did. But, I mean…if I’m being fully honest, she just didn’t hug Lonnie the same way she did Peter. She would watch him in the yard, and then turn away, back to Peter. And I would find myself changing his diapers, feeding him, putting himputting to him to bed, and later taking him to preschool. Granted, she’d pick him up more often than not, but the mornings—they were devoted to Peter. It’s not like she hated Lonnie.—why would she ever hate Lonnie? But then, six months after Lonnie was born, the doctor said he had Klinefelter syndrome. They suspected it since birth, but with everything else that needed to be done, with both Alyssa and Lonnie, they didn’t get it done for six months. And I was fine with it. Lonnie is, and always will be, my son. But Alyssa…really, it was after that, she still loved him, but that love…was reserved. Like there was a specific amount of care she would give him, and if it ran out, I would have to take over. I mean, look, she didn’t kill Lonnie. I don’t care how much she loved or hated him, but Alyssa is not a murderer. She couldn’t stand watching her dog be put to sleep when she was sixteen, so how could she ever kill a human being? Much less her own son. I really think your theory that she didn’t love her son because he had Klinefelter’s, that she thought Lonnie was imperfect, or tainted, or whatever, that she was somehow revolted by her own son—not true. I’m telling you the truth. The truth and nothing but. So for the love of God, trust me. My wife is not a murderer.”
        	The interviewer sighed. By now, Hugo had determined that it was not Kissinger. Probably another detective assisting the investigation. “Look, Jens, I understand that this is your family on the line. You’ve invested more than ten years into your marriage and children. If you think I’m a villain, fine. But hear me out. Anna Kramer, your sister-in-law, has described your wife’s behavior over the past month and a half. Every time they met, Alyssa would be aloof, dissatisfied with her life somehow. And we all know her career was as good as it gets. Alyssa admitted that there was a big problem in her family, one she didn’t know how to fix. That was September 19, one month ago. And then, three weeks later, when they meet again, she says that she thinks she knows what to do, and it’s only a matter of whether or not she can go through with it. She tells Anna that she hopes when the time comes, she has the will to do it. Now, given what happened less than a week after she said that, what am I left to believe?”
        	“What…I…what are you…no, no, what?” Jens searched the room and began to pull the words for his response together. “That’s—that’s not true. I mean, yeah, Alyssa was acting a bit aloof in the past few weeks, and she would be upset and unhappy at times, but that doesn’t mean anything! She’s just stressed about her family and career—balancing the two is hard for anyone! And I can’t believe she said those things. Honestly, I think you’re bluffing. I don’t think anything like that was ever said. Alyssa wouldn’t say that. You’re just trying to get me to say what you want.”
        	“You can deny it all you want, Jens, but it’s true. I have Anna’s statement on record. Now, are you going to face the truth, or keep hiding? Sooner or later, you’ll have to accept it. It’s not out of nowhere, either. We finished our psychological examination of Alyssa—we believe she has some form of depression or schizophrenia. We’re still working on the exact condition, but we’ve determined that her psychological state is not the same as a normal person. She is almost certainly prone to intrusive, erratic thoughts. She’s also vulnerable to irrational feelings of fear and disgust, and these emotions are expected to amplify when under stress. So you’ve told me that she’s stressed in her current life, she has a son with a chromosomal disorder, and her thoughts are intrusive to the point where she ignores her students and provides limited support to her only PhD student. Then, following your son’s murder, she lied about being on the couch at the time your son died, and she won’t so much as approach her son’s body with you, let alone accompany you or her dead son to the hospital.” The detective paused, but immediately resumed. “I don’t expect you to know for sure what happened that night. But if you don’t cooperate with me, it won’t look good if our investigation reveals something new. We already have quite a bit to convict her, but maybe Lorenzo or someone at forensics will find something that runs counter to what you’ve said. If so, you could face charges. Are you sure of what you’re saying, Jens?”
        	Silence filled the room. Light continued to shine from the side of the room. Hugo glanced upwards and looked to his left and right. Nobody. He was still in the clear. He continued to wait for Jens’ answer, hoping that he would have something to counter the interrogator. His breathing was imperceptibly soft, but Hugo could suddenly hear it with terrifying clarity.
        	“I…God, I don’t know what to say anymore. I’ve told you what I know. But I swear, you’re pushing this too far. If she’s innocent, this is slander. I can’t believe you’d say that she thinks her son is “dirty” because he’s not the “ideal son”. What are you thinking?. Please, please, give her a chance. Even if she loved Peter more—and that’s quite an if, you know—she wouldn’t kill Lonnie just because he interfered with this stupid fantasy of an “ideal family”. We were the ideal family! All four of us! Don’t you dare refine our family! We’ll…we’ll never be whole again…”
        	Heavy breathing sounded from the room. A moment of silence was given. “I think we’re done here, Jens. I pray you’ll find peace with your son’s death. I’m sorry to have to do this to you, but I hope you understand. If you ever need anything, just call me or Lorenzo. Good luck.”

        	They had left fifteen minutes ago. Jens first, who went straight down the hall to the elevator, and then the interrogator a minute later, with a manila folder of files not unlike the ones Kramer kept her research notes in. Neither paid any attention to Hugo, who had just been standing in the hallway. The dim lights. The off-white walls. The brown door at the end that led to the visitor’s room. The dull yellow doorknob. Hugo stared down at his own feet, pointing slightly apart from each other. What did he think? Did she do it? He didn’t want to think that she did. She was such a kind woman. But many didn’t think so. She would never kill anyone, right? But that distant gaze in her eyes never seemed to be about her research. Why didn’t he realize it earlier? Well, statistics said she was innocent, right? The number of child bathtub deaths that were unfortunate accidents was far bigger than the number of child bathtub deaths that were homicides. He didn’t actually know the statistics, but surely, that was true, right?
        	Would they convict her? She would need to be guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, right? Surely—surely there was reasonable doubt in this case! Even if everything the police said was true, that wouldn’t be enough to convict her, right?
        	Hugo checked his phone. 4:22 PM. Visiting hours would close in forty minutes. If he wanted to see Kramer, it had to be now. Otherwise, he’d have to wait another week—and he knew he couldn’t. As he approached the brown door, though, he considered what he’d ask her—could he really ask her? Could he muster up enough courage?
        	His hand on the yellow doorknob, Hugo decided to turn it. He had to know. He had to at least try.

        	Not long after he entered the waiting room, a guard called him in. Another door led him to a long row of seats facing a platform that led all the way down to the far wall. Glass panes separated by thin walls designated the difference between citizen and prisoner. He would have to communicate by telephone. The guard silently pointed to the fourth seat. Hugo sat in it—there she was. Professor Kramer.
        	“Hugo. I’m so glad to see you. I hope this hasn’t been too hard on you.” Even now, her eyes had that same warmth in them he remembered from before.
        	“Ah, I’m fine. Things have been going well on my end. Really, I hope things are okay for you right now. I heard everything from Professor Young. I mean, I hope you’re doing okay, after everything that’s happened.”
        	Kramer seemed to consider smiling for a moment. “Well, thanks for checking on me. I really appreciate it. I’ve spoken to Jens, Paul, Veblen, and others close to me ever since they took me into custody. I just hope I’m released soon so I can see Peter again. How’s school these days? I would expect that your workload is still just as burdensome as it usually is, even with everything going on.”
        	Ah, um…” Hugo didn’t expect to talk about school, of all things. “Well, the lectures are going well. Students seem…a bit disinterested, but I guess school is tiring for everyone. And my dissertation…well, I guess it’s making progress.” Hugo felt that burning itch—that itch for an answer. Could he ask it?
        	“That’s good to hear. In case the administration lets me go, who will be your advisor? Hopefully you’ve thought about it, but if not, I can help arrange something.”
        	“Professor Young. He said he wouldn’t mind being my advisor, and I guess it’d be him. I don’t really think Hoskins has anyone else doing algebraic number theory, or anything close to it. I haven’t formally asked him, but I think he’ll agree.”
        	“That’s good. I’m sure you’ll enjoy working with him. He’s incredible inat his field, you know. One of the pioneers of projective geometry. You’ll learn so much from him—when I first spoke to him three years ago, he made me feel like a student all over again!” Professor Kramer let out a small chuckle as she looked to the side. He started to build his courage. If there was a time to ask, it was now.
        	“So, Hugo, what do you plan to do after you get your PhD? Where do you plan to go? I can help you in getting a position at a university—I’ve been there before.”
        	Ask! Just ask! If you don’t ask now, you’ll never get another chance! But Hugo tried to force the words out, and nothing came out. His mouth just twitched, with nothing vocalized. Nothing but air. Could he ask? Guess not, he thought to himself. He tried again. Get the words out. Pronounce them. Announce them. He knew that asking would end his association with Professor Kramer, no matter what the answer was, but he no longer cared. He had to know. But air emerged again. His words sank into oblivion. He wouldn’t know, then. He really wouldn’t know. As he answered Professor Kramer’s questions, he asked himself if he could make do with the prospect of not knowing for the rest of his life. He would have to, no? He would never be able to ask. As the conversation wrapped up, Hugo began to resign himself to leaving the issue the way it was.
